INTRODUCTION
Partner Engineering and Science, [FLAG]Inc[/FLAG]. (Partner) has performed a [FLAG]Phase[/F[FLAG]LAG] I [FLAG]Environmental Site Assessment[/FLAG]
(ESA[/FLAG]) in conformance with the[FLAG] scope and limitations of ASTM St[FLAG]andard Practice E1527[/FLAG]-13 and the
Environ[FLAG]mental Protection Agency[/FLAG] Standards and Practices for All Appro[FLAG]priate Inquiries[/FLAG] [FLAG]([FLAG]AA[/FLAG]I) (40 CFR Part
312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street[/FLAG] in [FLAG]Vernon[/FLAG], Los Angeles County[/FLAG], California (the
“subject property”).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.
1.1
Purpose
The purpose of this [FLAG]E[/FLAG]SA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as
defined by AST[FLAG]M Standard E-152[/FLAG]7-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a
material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any
material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use
thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with resp[FLAG]ect to Ha[FLAG]zardous Substances[/FLAG] or
Petroleum Products[/FLAG] on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may
affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard
to such conditions and circumstances.
This [FLAG]E[/FLAG]SA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent
landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purch[FLAG]aser limitations on sco[FLAG]pe [FLAG]of
Com[FLAG]prehensive Environmental Response,[/FLAG] Compensation and Liability Act[/FLAG] (CERCLA[/FLAG]) [FLAG](42 U.S.C[/FLAG]. §9601)
liability (hereinafter, the “landowner liability protections,” or “LLPs”).  ASTM Standard E-152[/FLAG]7-13
constitutes “all appropriate inquiry[FLAG] into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with
good commercial or customary practice” as defined at 42 U.S.C[/[FLAG]FLAG]. §9601(35)(B).
In order to qualify for one of the [FLAG]LL[/FLAG]Ps offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields
Revitalization Act of[/FLAG] 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information
(if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a
determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or
knowledge of the following:
•
Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site.
•
Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a
registry.
•
Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs.
•
Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated.
•
Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property.
•
The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and
the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment.
•
The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA.
Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA
liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in
Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.
1.2
Scope of Work
The scope of work for this E[FLAG]SA[/FLAG] is in accordance with the requirements of A[FLAG]STM Standard E[/FLAG] 1527-13 and
the[FLAG] contract between LBA Realty[/FLAG] and [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] dated October 14, 2013.
This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key
personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a
regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] contacted local agencies, such as
environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for
review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of
hazardous substances on the subject property.
Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limi[FLAG]tations (AULs) at the appropriate
agencies.  As defined by ASTM E15[/FLAG]27-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the
use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances
or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that
could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition
of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may
include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to
individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the
soil or groundwater on the property.
If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited
sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or
radon.
1.3
Limitations
Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance
with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of [FLAG]Work[/FLAG].  These methodologies are described as
representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an [FLAG]E[/FLAG]SA of a property for the
purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the
proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could
not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the
available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the
interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] cannot and does not warrant or
guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions
and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations.
The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on
scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting
restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed.
Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of
available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This
report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent
records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted.
This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than
the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the [FLAG]LL[/FLAG]Ps.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the
safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property.
Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I [FLAG]E[/FLAG]SA as defined by ASTM include the
following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the
subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope
issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.
1.4
User Reliance
Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations stated in the Master Services [FLAG]Agreeme[FLAG]nt[/FLAG] (MSA[/FLAG]) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner[FLAG]
Engineering an[FLAG]d Science, Inc[/FLAG]. and LBA Real[FLAG]ty, LLC[/FLAG] and its assigns.
Bank of America, N. A[/FLAG]., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in
evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also
be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject
property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N[FLAG].A. and such additional lender is referred to as
the “Mortgage Loan[/FLAG]”) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the
Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in
a[FLAG]ny securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan[/FLAG] (or any portion thereof),
any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any
institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In
addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular,
priv[FLAG]ate placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and
Science[/FLAG] agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a
securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities.
This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.
1.5
Limiting Conditions
The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are
referred to in ASTM E[FLAG]15[/FLAG]27-13.
Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below:
•
Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus
constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discusse[FLAG]d
in Section 3[/FLAG].0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] was
allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this
limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment.
•
An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG]’s opinion that
the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact
[FLAG]Partner[/FLAG]’s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and
therefore it does not alt[FLAG]er t[FLAG]he conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment[/FLAG] and
EDR[/FLAG] Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject
property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the
property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with
the subject property.

SITE DESCRIPTION

2.1
Site Location and Legal Description
The subject property at 4444 East 26th [FLAG]Street[/FLAG], [FLAG]Vernon[/FLAG], [FLAG]California[/FLAG] is located on the [FLAG]southwester[FLAG]n
intersection of East 26th Street[/FLAG] and Ay[FLAG]ers Avenue[/FLAG].  The subject property was inspected by Joseph Kim[/FLAG] of
[FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] on October 28, 2021.  The weather at the time of the site visit w[FLAG]as sunny and in the mid-70s
(degrees Fahrenheit). According to the Los Angeles County Assessor[/FLAG], the subject property is legally
described as OM 3-19-27 EX OF R/W AND STS LOT 3 DIV 105 REG 48 and is owned by LBA RVI –
Company VIII, LLC.
Please refer to Figure 1: Site Location Map, Figure 2: Site Plan, Figure 3: Topographic Map, and Appendix
A: Site Photographs for the location and site characteristics of the subject property.
2.2
Current Property Use
The subject property is currently occupied by JSour[FLAG]ce[/FLAG], a sub-[FLAG][FLAG]tenant of ACCO[/FLAG] (HVAC[/FLAG] equipment and
installation company).  Onsite operations consist of the warehousing and distribution of various consumer
merchandises.  An office area and a loading dock were located on the northeast corner and north side of
the building.  In addition to the current structure, the subject property is improved with paved parking
area and fencing.  Access to the subject property is provided via an entrance along Ayers Avenue.
2.3
Current Use of Adjacent Properties
The subject property is located within an industrial area.  During the vicinity reconnaissance, Partner
observed the following land use on properties in the immediate vicinity of the subject property:
Immediately Surrounding Properties
[FLAG]North[/FLAG[FLAG]]:
East 26th Street[/FLAG], followed by Atc[FLAG]hison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad[/FLAG] and railroad yard.
[FLAG]South[[FLAG]/FLAG]:
Abandoned ra[FLAG]ilroad spur, followed [FLAG]by Dollar Emp[FLAG]ire[/FLAG] (4425-4[FLAG]429 Bandini Boulevard[/FL[FLAG]AG]) and
Bake[FLAG]ry Depot Inc[/FLAG]. (4489 Bandini Bo[FLAG]ulevard[/FLAG]).
East:

Physical Setting Sources

2.4.1
Topography
2.4.1  Topography
The United States Geological [FLAG]Surv[FLAG]ey[FLAG][/FLAG] (USGS[/[FLAG]FLAG]) Los Angeles[/FLAG], California Quad[/FLAG]rangle 7.5-minute series
topographic map was reviewed for this ESA.  The subject property lies at an approximate elevation of 161
feet above mean sea level (msl) with a local topographic gradient toward the southeast.
A copy of the most recent topographic map is included as Figure 3.
2.4.2
Hydrology
According to information obtained from the State Water Resources Control [FLAG]Board[/FLAG] online d[FLAG]atabase,
GeoTracker[/FLAG], for a nearby release (Case Number T0603[FLAG]767053 – 4477 East Shelia Street[/FLAG]) and topographic
map interpretation, groundwater in the vicinity of the subject property is present at depth of 112 to 115
feet bgs and flows toward the south-southeast.
The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located
approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface
impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this
assessment.
2.4.3
Geology/Soils
The site is located in the Peninsular Range[FLAG]s[/FLAG] geomorphic province. The Pen[FLAG]insular Ranges[/FLAG] are a northwest-
southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend[FLAG] from the
Transv[FLAG]erse Ranges[/FLAG] and the Los Angeles Basin[/FLAG] south [FLAG]to the [FLAG]Mexican[/FLAG] border and beyond to [FLAG]the tip of Baja
C[FLAG]alifornia[/FLAG] and are bo[FLAG]unded on the east by the Colorado Desert[/FLAG] and the Gulf of California[/FLAG].  [FLAG]The Peninsular
[FLAG]Ranges[/FLAG] contain minor [FLAG]Jurassic[/FLAG] and [FLAG]extensive [FLAG]Cretaceous[/FLAG] igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan[/FLAG]
plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous[/FLAG] sedimentary rocks are well re[FLAG]presented,[FLAG] and post-Cretaceous[/FLAG] rocks form a
rest[FLAG]ricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments.
Based on i[FLAG]nformation obtained from the United[FLAG] States Department of Agriculture[/FLAG] (USDA[/FLAG]) Natural
Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey[/[FLAG]FLAG] online database, the subject property is mapped as
[FLAG]Urban[/FLAG] land-Biscailuz[/FLAG]-[FLAG]Hu[/FLAG]eneme, drained complex.  The [FLAG]B[/FLAG]iscailuz[/FLAG] series consists of very deep, somewhat
poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. [FLAG]B[/FLAG]iscail[/FLAG]uz soils are on floodplains
and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand
and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray
and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and
containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they
cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and
shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.
2.4.4
Flood Zone Information
[FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] performed a review of the Flood In[FLAG]surance Rate Map[/FLAG], published by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.  According to Community Panel Number 06037C1643F, dated September 26, 2008,
the subject property appears to be located in Zone X, an area located outside of the 100-year and 500-
year flood plains.
3.0
HISTORICAL INFORMATION
[FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] obtained historical use information about the subject property from a variety of sources.
Information regarding past land use was obtained by a review of historical aerial photographs, historical
[FLAG]Sanborn Fire Insurance[/FLAG] maps, city directories, and historical topographic maps of the subject property and
surrounding area obtaine[FLAG]d from Environmental Data Resources[/FLAG] (EDR).  Copies of the historical r[FLAG]esources are
included in Appendix B[FLAG].  EDR[/FLAG] reported that Sanborn Fire Insurance Map[/FLAG]s were available for the subject

According to review of available historical data, it appears that the subject property was agriculturally
developed land from 1928 to at least 1938.  Aerial photography and a 1950 Sanborn map indicate that by
1948 a lumber yard was operated onsite on the southern half of the property. By 1964 the current
building was visible on aerial photographs. Since that time, various commercial/industrial tenants have
occupied the building including:

Common agricultural practices can result in residual concentrations of fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides in
near-surface soil, though not generally at concentrations that pose a significant health risk.  It is Partner’s
opinion that, since the site has been graded, redeveloped, and paved, remaining pesticide or herbicide
residues, if any, are likely to have been dispersed during these construction activities and therefore are
unlikely to impact human health or the environment.  Accordingly, no further investigation is recommended
regarding potential residual pesticide.

Mapped Database Records Search
Information from standard federal, state, county, and city environmental record sources was provided by
Environmental Data Resources, [FLAG]I[FLAG]nc[/FLAG]. (EDR[/FLAG]).  Data from governmental agency lists are updated and
integrated into one database, which is updated as these data are released.  The information contained in
this report was compiled from publicly available sources and the locations of the sites are plotted utilizing
a geographic information system, which geocodes the site addresses.  The accuracy of the geocoded
locations is approximately [FLAG]+/-300 feet.  Using the ASTM[/FLAG] definition of migration, [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] considers the
migration of hazardous substances or petroleum products in any form onto the subject property during
the evaluation of each site listed on the radius report, which includes solid, liquid, and vapor.  A copy of

Subject Property
The agency database report obtained from Environmental Data Resources, [FLAG]I[FLAG]nc[/FLAG]. (EDR[/FLAG]) identified the subject
prope[FLAG]rty [FLAG]as:
•
ACCO Engineered Systems[/FL[FLAG]AG] (EDR[/FLAG] Map ID: A1), is identified on the CERS[/FLAG] database.  The facility is
identified as a chemical storage facility.  Minor violations, administrative in nature (failure to
submit a hazardo[FLAG]us materi[FLAG]als business plan), were issued in 2014 and 2015.
•
F&S Distribution[/FLAG] (EDR[/FLAG] Map ID: A3, A5, A8, A10, A11, A13, A16),[FLAG] is identified on the SWEEPS UST,
FINDS, FTTS, HIST FTTS, HIST UST,[FLAG] [FLAG]N[/FLAG]PDES, Waste Discharge System[/FLAG] (WDS), [FLAG]EC[/FLAG]HO, HWTS, and
HAZNET databases.  The SWEEPS UST and HIST US[/FLAG]T databases identified two USTs including
5,000-gallon regular gasoline UST and 10,000-gallon diesel UST, installed in 1980.  No removal
dates were provided.  The facility is identified on the [FLAG]H[/FLAG]AZNET database for generating state-
regulated w[FLAG]astes including “other organic solids and off-specification, aged, or surplus organics”
that were manifested for[FLAG] off-site disposal in 1997 and 1998. The FINDS[/FLAG] database identified the
facility as a [FLAG]T[/FLAG]SCA Submitter.  As discussed in Section 4.1.3, according to City of Vernon EHD[/FLAG]
records reviewed by Partner, in March 1994, the facility was reportedly warehousing about
120,000 pounds of sodium cyanide every 3 to 4 months. The facility discontinued warehousing
the sodium cyanide to avoid being required to prepare a RMPP.  By May 24, 1994, the cyanide
was no longer onsite.
•
LBA Realty (EDR Map ID: A4), is identified on the HAZNET and HWTS databases. This facility is
listed in the HAZNET database for generating state-regulated wastes including “Asbestos
containing waste” that were manifested for off-site disposal in 2018. Based on the regulatory
status and lack of listings in other databases indicating violations and/or a release, this listing is
not considered to have created an environmental concern to the subject property.
•
ACTEO Corporation (EDR Map ID: A6, A7), is identified on the CERS, HAZNET and HWTS
databases. This facility is identified on the HAZNET database for generating state-regulated
wastes including “laboratory waste and off-specification, aged, or surplus organics” that were
manifested for off-site disposal in 2000 and 2001.
•
H&S Marketing (EDR Map ID: A9), is identified on the HIST UST, HWTS, and HAZNET databases.
No information is listed on the HIST UST database.  The facility is identified on the HAZNET
database for generating state-regulated wastes including “off-specification, aged, or surplus
organics” that were manifested for off-site disposal in 2010.
•
Witco Corp. (EDR Map ID: A2, A12, A14, A18), is identified on the RCRA-SQG, ECHO, FINDS,
HWTS, and HAZNET databases. The facility is identified on the HAZNET database for generating
state-regulated wastes including “pesticides and other waste associated with pesticide
production, other organic solids, liquids w/pH<=2, and off-specification, aged, or surplus
organics” that were manifested for off-site disposal in 1998.
•
California Transport (EDR Map ID: A15, A17), is identified on the RCRA-SQG, FINDS, ECHO, and
HAZNET databases.  No RCRA violations were listed. RCRA Code D039 (tetrachloroethylene) was
listed. The facility is identified on the HAZNET database for generating state-regulated wastes
including “aqueous solution with total organic residues less than 10 percent” that were
manifested for off-site disposal between 2011 and 2014.
Based on the information provided in the EDR Database report and results of the Phase II investigation
(see Section 5.2.6), these listings are not considered to have the potential to create an environmental
concern at the subject property.
4.2.3
Adjacent Properties
The EDR [FLAG]Report[/FLAG] identified the following facilities adjacent to the subject property:[FLAG]
[FLAG]•
[FLAG]A[/FLAG]grashell Inc[/FLAG]. ([FLAG]EDR[/FLAG] Map ID: 50), is listed at[FLAG] 4560 East 26th Street[/FLAG], adjacent to the east beyond
[FLAG]Aye[/FLAG]rs Avenue[/FLAG] and hydrologically cross-gradient of the subject property.  The facility is[FLAG] listed as a
SWEEPS UST, HIST UST, [FLAG]C[/FLAG]IWQS, [FLAG]CE[/FLAG]RS, and [FLAG]EMI[/FLAG] databases. The SWEEPS UST and HIST US[/FLAG]T
databases identified one 1,000-gallon gasoline UST installed in 1952.  No removal dates were
provided. Based on the regulatory status and lack of listing in other databases indicating
violations[FLAG] and/or [FLAG]a release, it is [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG]’s opinion that this listing does not represent an
environmental concern to the subject property.
•
Fortifiber Corporation[/FLAG] (EDR[/FLAG] [FLAG]Map ID: 19), is li[FLAG]sted [FLAG]at 4489 Bandi[FLAG]ni Boulevard, adjacent to the south
and hydrologically down-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed as a FINDS, SWEEPS
UST, HIST US[/FLAG]T, [FLAG]RC[/FLAG]RA-SQG, [FLAG]H[/FLAG]AZNET, WDS[/FLAG], and ECHO[/FLAG] databases.  No RCRA[/FLAG] violations were listed.
The [FLAG]S[/FLAG]WEEPS UST and HIST UST databases identified three USTs including two 12,000-gallon
gasoline USTs and one 6,000-gallon gasoline UST installed in[FLAG] 1956.  No removal dates[FLA[FLAG]G] were
provided.  Based on the regul[FLAG]atory status and lack of listing in other databases indicating
violations and/or a release, it is [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG]’s opinion that this listing does not represent an
environmental concern to the subject property.
•
Penetone Corp[/FLAG] Div. of West Chemical Prod[/FLAG] (EDR[/FLAG] Map ID: C23), is listed at 4425 Bandini Boulevard[/FLAG],
adjacent to the southwest and hydrologically down-gradient of the subject property.  The facility is
listed as a [FLAG]RC[/FLAG]RA-SQG, FINDS and [FLAG]EC[/FLAG]HO databases.  No [FLAG]RC[/FLAG]RA violations were listed. Based on the
regulatory status and lack of listing in other databases indicating violations and/or a release, it is
Partner’s opinion that this listing does not represent an environmental concern to the subject
property.
Based on the findings, vapor migration is not expected to represent a significant environmental concern
at this time.
4.2.4
Site Vicinity
[FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] r[FLAG]eviewed the EDR[/FLAG] database report to identify offsite facilities that have suspected or documented
environmental concerns or RECs that may negatively impact the subject property.  [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG]’s criteria for
further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below:
•
The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a
likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the
subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through
other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and,
•
The offsite facility is listed as an open case on on[FLAG]e of the foll[FLAG]owing data[FLAG]bases: F[FLAG]ederal NPL[/FLAG],
Federal CORRACTS[/FLAG], Federal CERCLIS[/FLAG], Federal[FLAG] ERNS[/FL[FLAG]AG], a[FLAG]nd State-Specif[FLAG]ic lists includi[FLAG]n[FLAG]g, but not
limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites[/FLAG], State SCL[/FLAG], State LUST[/FLAG], State Deed Restrictions[/FLAG], State Toxic
Pits[/FLAG], Landfill[/FLAG] (excluding transfer stations); or
•
The facility is a known or[FLAG] suspected concern based on [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG]’s experience or observations made
during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that[FLAG] may or may not be listed as
RCRA[/FLAG]-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place).
Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTrack[FLAG][FLAG]er[/FLAG], several up-gradient facilities
in the si[FLAG]te vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The
following facilities have an open release case:
•
Weld-It Co[/FLAG]. (EDR[/FLAG] Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street[/FLAG], approximately 1,024
feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release
from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene
(TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater.
The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as “Open-Site
Assessment” as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was
abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a
cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring
report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as
gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring
wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property).
The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE
was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (µg/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24
µg/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted
groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under
it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to
the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing
to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater
(last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September
26, 2018.
•
Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the
north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los
Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA
County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site
has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier
Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four
years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released
into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided
oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in
1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a "No Further Action" for
soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified
at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may
have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as “Inactive –Action Required”
as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available.
Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity.
Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be
unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.
4.2.5
Unmapped Sites
[FLAG]Partner[/FLA[FLAG]G] reviewed[FLAG] EDR[/FLAG]’s Orphan Summary[/FLAG], which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on
lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.  The subject prop[FLAG]erty was not
identifie[FLAG]d as an Unmapped Site[/FLAG]. [FLAG] None of the Unmapped Sites[/FL[FLAG]AG] identified on the [FLAG]Or[/FLAG]phan Summary[/FLAG] appear to
be located within the ASTM[/FLAG]-designated radii of the subject property, and therefore, Partner has no reason to
believe that these sites had an impact on the subject property.
4.3
Vapor Encroachment Screening
[FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] reviewed the environmental database records identified in th[FLAG]e EDR Radius Report[/FLAG] and evaluated
each reported site relative to a subsurface vapor encroachment condition, respective a known release, the
chemicals of concern, the distance that contaminants are likely to migrate based on local geological and
hydrological conditions, sub-grade utility corridors and preferential pathways, structural components,
mitigation devices, and other reasonable factors.
The subsurface vapor encroachment screening was completed in conformance with ASTM International
Designation: E2600-15: Standard Guide for Vapor Encroachment Screening on Property Inv[FLAG]olved in Real
Estate Transactions[/FLAG] (“ASTM Guide E2600-15”) using Tier 1 Screening procedures.
4.3.1
On-Site Sources for a Vapor Encroachment Condition
Based on a review of previous reports, agency records, and current site observations, on-site sources with
the potential to create a subsurface vapor encroachment concern to the subject property and its receptors
were not identified. As such, a subsurface vapor encroachment condition on the subject property relative
to an on-site contaminant source does not exist.
4.3.2
Off-Site Sources for a Vapor Encroachment Condition
Based on [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG]’s review o[FLAG]f the [FLAG]Ra[/FLAG]dius Report[/FLAG], no off-site properties with the potential to create a
subsurface vapor encroachment concern to the subject property and its receptors were identified. No off-
site properties with a documented open release of petroleum hydrocarbons were identified within the
critical distance - 30 feet up-gradient, cross-gradient, or down-gradient[FLAG] of the subject property in the
[FLAG]Ra[/FLAG]dius Report[/FLAG]. No off-site properties with a documented release of other contaminants of concern such
chlorinated volatile organic hydrocarbons were identified within the critical distance - 100 feet up-
gradient, cross-gradient, or down-gradient of the subject property in the [FLAG]Ra[/FLAG]dius Report.
Based on the physical setting of the subject property and the findings from historical and regulatory
records review, an off-site source for a subsurface vapor encroachment condition was not identified in
association with the subject property. As such, a subsurface vapor encroachment condition on the subject
property relative to off-site contaminant source does not exist.

In December 2017, [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] prepared a Phase I ESA[/FLAG] and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject
property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing
office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage
on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was
occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of
products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed
mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and
various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were
observed to be heavily stained.
Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and
multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, “PVC powder”, and plastic materials,
stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant
were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used
onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing
hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site
manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and
were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately.
According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000-
gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and
an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the
truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and
10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel
tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination
was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was
excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The
Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the
excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs
was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD
files.
According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4’X30’ overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject
property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An
attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of
the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the
existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated
seepage pits.
On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to
evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential
impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck
maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase
II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples
were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil
samples were analyzed for cyanide.
Analytical results indicated:
•
None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above
laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines.
•
None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded
applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples
above applicable regulatory guidelines.
•
Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not
exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil
sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of
arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil
samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations.
•
None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels.
The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the
north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a
backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features
were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional
USTs were installed.
Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and
remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result
of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be
negatively impacting the subject property at that time.
Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair
bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time.
In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC.
According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site.
These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities,
renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc.
In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI – Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018
assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition
of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space
(northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest
corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed
crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is
located adjacent to the south side of the building.
No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite
AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of
current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the
northwest corner of the subject property.
In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November
2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located
on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current
renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal.
Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues:
•
In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface
Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and
to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the
former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide
products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results,
the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are
considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary.
•
Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing
material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be
sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition
activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner
recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program.
Partner recommended no further investigation.
In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site
visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of
the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site
operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities.
No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject
property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs)
was observed during the site reconnaissance.
The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner.
Partner recommended no further investigation.
Copies of reports reviewed are included in Appendix B.

General Site Characteristics

6.1.1
Solid Waste Disposal
Solid waste generated at the subject property is disposed in commercial dumpsters located in the western
portion of the subject property.  An independent solid waste disposal contractor, Waste [FLAG]Management[/FLAG],
removes solid waste from the subject property.  No evidence of illegal dumping of solid waste was
observed during the Partner site reconnaissance.   No further investigation or corrective actions are
warranted.
6.1.2
Sewage Discharge and Disposal
Sanitary discharges on the subject property are directed into the municipal sanitary sewer system
operated by the City of Vernon.
6.1.3
Surface Water Drainage
Storm water is removed from the subject property primarily by sheet flow action across the paved
surfaces towards storm water drains located throughout the subject property and in the public right of
way.  Site storm water from roofs, landscaped areas, and paved areas is directed to on-site concrete
swales, which drain to the public right of way, and to on-site storm water drains.  The subject property is
connected to a municipal owned and maintained sewer system.
The subject property does not appear to be a designated wetland area, based on information obtained
from the United States Department of Agriculture.  A comprehensive wetlands survey would be required
in order to formally determine actual wetlands on the subject property.  No surface impoundments,
wetlands, natural catch basins, settling ponds, or lagoons are located on the subject property.  No
drywells were identified on the subject property.
6.1.4
Source of Heating and Cooling
Heating and cooling systems as well as domestic hot water equipment are fueled by electricity and natural
gas provided by Southern California [FLAG]Edis[FLAG]on[/FLAG] (SCE[/FLAG]) and the Southern California Gas Company.
6.1.5
Wells and Cisterns
No aboveground evidence of wells or cisterns was observed during the site reconnaissance.
6.1.6
Wastewater
Domestic wastewater generated at the subject property is disposed by means of the sanitary sewer
system.  No industrial process is performed at the subject property.
6.1.7
Septic Systems
No septic systems were observed or reported on the subject property.
6.1.8
Additional Site Observations
No additional general site characteristics were observed during the site reconnaissance.
6.2
Potential Environmental Hazards

6.2.1
Hazardous Substances and Petroleum Products Used or Stored at the Site
No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject
property.  Small quantities of general maintenance supplies were found to be properly labeled and stored
at the time of the assessment with no signs of leaks, stains, or spills.  The storage and use of maintenance
supplies does not appear to pose a significant threat to the environmental integrity of the subject
property at this time.
6.2.2
Aboveground & Underground Hazardous Substance or Petroleum Product Storage
Tanks (ASTs/USTs)
No evidence of current or former [FLAG]AS[/FLAG]Ts or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.
6.2.3
Evidence of Releases
No spills, stains, or other indications that a surficial release has occurred at the subject property were
observed.
6.2.4
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)
Older transformers and other electrical equipment could contain PCBs at a level that subjects them to
regulation by the U.S. [FLAG]EPA[/FLAG].  PCBs in electrical equipment are controlled by United States Environmenta[FLAG]l
Protection Agency[/FLAG] regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under the regulations, there are three categories into
which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs – “Non-PCB;”
2) 50 ppm-500 ppm – “PCB-Contaminated;” and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm – “PCB-Containing.”  The
manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally
enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979.
The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad-
mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating
PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer.
No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock
levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner’s
reconnaissance.
6.2.5
Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors
No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.
6.2.6
Pools of Liquid
No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.
6.2.7
Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers
No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on
the subject property during the site reconnaissance.
6.2.8
Pits, Ponds and Lagoons
No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.
6.2.9
Stressed Vegetation
No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.

6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards
No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.
6.3
Non-ASTM Services

6.3.1
Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs)
Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their
useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The
Occupational Safety and Health [FLAG]Administrati[FLAG]on[/FLAG] (OSHA[/FLAG]) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain
construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction
materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and
asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be
considered “presumed asbestos-containing material” (PACM).
The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] has conducted a limited, visual evaluation
of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual
survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect [FLAG]AC[/FLAG]M observed.  Please refer to the table below
for identified suspect ACMs:

The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible
and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to poten[FLAG]tially contain
asbestos.
According to the [FLAG]US[/FLAG] [FLAG]EPA[/FLAG], ACM[/FLAG] and PACM that is in[FLAG]tact and in g[FLAG]ood condition can, in general, be
managed safely in-place under an Operations and[/FLAG] Maintenance (O&M[/FLAG]) Program until removal is dictated
by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of th[FLAG]e
construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive [FLAG]AC[/FLAG]M survey is recommended.  [FLAG]AC[/FLAG]M is
managed under the LBA[/FLAG] Realty O&M Program.
6.3.2
Lead-Based Paint (LBP)
Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  [FLAG]L[/FLAG]BP is defined as any paint,
varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of
lead.
Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of
this assessment.
6.3.3
Radon
[FLAG]Ra[/FLAG]don is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by
radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The [FLAG]US[/FLAG] [FLAG]EPA[/FLAG] has prepared a map to assist [FLAG]National[/FLAG], [FLAG]State[/FLAG], and
local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resista[FLAG]nt building codes.  The map
divides the c[FLAG]ountry into three Radon Zone[/FLAG]s, according to the table below:
EPA Radon Zone[/FLAG]s
[FLAG]EPA[/FLAG] Zones
Average Predicted Radon Levels
Potential
Zone 1
Exceed 4.0 pCi/L
Highest
Zone 2
Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L
Moderate
Zone 3
Less than 2.0 pCi/L
Low
It is important to note that the [FLAG]EPA[/FLAG] has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and
the [FLAG]US[/FLAG] [FLAG]EPA[/FLAG] recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location.
However, the map does give a valuable indication of [FLAG]the propensity of radon gas accumulation in
structures.
Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the [FLAG]US[/FLAG] EPA Map of[/FLAG] Radon
Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not
considered to be a significant environmental concern.
6.3.4
Lead in Drinking Water
According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works
Water & Development [FLAG]Services[/FLAG] serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath
the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of
[FLAG]Vernon[/FLAG] are surface water from the Metropolitan W[FLAG]ater Dis[FLAG]trict of Southern Californ[FLAG]ia[/FLAG] (MWD[/FLAG]) which is a
blend of Col[FLAG]orado River[/FLAG] water and water from the northern State Water Project[/FLAG] a[FLAG]s well as groundwater
pu[FLAG]mped from local deep wells in the Cent[FLAG]ral Groundwater Basin[/FLAG].  According to the City of[/FLAG] [FLAG]Vernon[/FLAG] and the
2020 Annual Water Quality Report[/FLAG], water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all [FLAG]State[/FLAG]
and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.  Water
sampling was not conducted to verify water quality.
6.3.5
Microbial Growth
Microbial growths are microscopic organisms found virtually everywhere, indoors and outdoors.
Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture
(e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic
material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding).
[FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of
microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this [FLAG]E[/FLAG]SA should not
be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess
all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property.
Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed
areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe
chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings.
No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner’s visual
assessment.
6.4
Adjacent Property Reconnaissance
The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject
property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during
the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, [FLAG]AS[/FLAG]Ts, USTs, evidence of
releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed
vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards.

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
Findings
A recognized environmental condition ([FLAG]R[/FLAG]EC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous
substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under
conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a
future release to the environment.
•
Partner did not identify [FLAG]R[/FLAG]ECs during the course of this assessment.
A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a [FLAG]R[/FLAG]EC resulting from a past release of
hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable
regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject
to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this
assessment:
•
Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment.
A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous
substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been
addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria
established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The
following was identified during the course of this assessment:
•
In December 2017, [FLAG]Partner[/FLAG] conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface
Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site [FLAG]US[/FLAG]T tankholds and
to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the
former [FLAG]US[/FLAG]Ts, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide
products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey,
and the analytical results, the former [FLAG]US[/FLAG]Ts, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of
cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary.
An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as
RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this
assessment:
•
Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment.
