Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Based on the regulatory status and lack of listing in other databases indicating violations and/or a release, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that this listing does not represent an environmental concern to the subject property. Based on the findings, vapor migration is not expected to represent a significant environmental concern at this time.", "4.2.4": " 4.2.4 Site Vicinity Partner reviewed the EDR database report to identify offsite facilities that have suspected or documented environmental concerns or RECs that may negatively impact the subject property.  Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

No off- site properties with a documented open release of petroleum hydrocarbons were identified within the critical distance - 30 feet up-gradient, cross-gradient, or down-gradient of the subject property in the Radius Report. No off-site properties with a documented release of other contaminants of concern such chlorinated volatile organic hydrocarbons were identified within the critical distance - 100 feet up- gradient, cross-gradient, or down-gradient of the subject property in the Radius Report. Based on the physical setting of the subject property and the findings from historical and regulatory records review, an off-site source for a subsurface vapor encroachment condition was not identified in association with the subject property.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

Under the regulations, there are three categories into which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs \u2013 \u201cNon-PCB;\u201d 2) 50 ppm-500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Contaminated;\u201d and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Containing.\u201d  The manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad- mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer. No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner\u2019s reconnaissance.", "6.2.5": " 6.2.5 Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.6": " 6.2.6 Pools of Liquid No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.7": " 6.2.7 Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.8": " 6.2.8 Pits, Ponds and Lagoons No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.", "6.2.9": " 6.2.9 Stressed Vegetation No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.", "6.2.10": " 6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.", "6.3": " 6.3 Non-ASTM Services", "6.3.1": " 6.3.1 Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) which is a blend of Colorado River water and water from the northern State Water Project as well as groundwater pumped from local deep wells in the Central Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon and the 2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.  Water sampling was not conducted to verify water quality.", "6.3.5": " 6.3.5 Microbial Growth Microbial growths are microscopic organisms found virtually everywhere, indoors and outdoors. Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should not be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property. Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings. No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner\u2019s visual assessment.", "6.4": " 6.4 Adjacent Property Reconnaissance The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.  An HREC were identified.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.

(September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

PCBs in electrical equipment are controlled by United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under the regulations, there are three categories into which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs \u2013 \u201cNon-PCB;\u201d 2) 50 ppm-500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Contaminated;\u201d and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Containing.\u201d  The manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad- mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer. No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner\u2019s reconnaissance.", "6.2.5": " 6.2.5 Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.6": " 6.2.6 Pools of Liquid No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.7": " 6.2.7 Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.8": " 6.2.8 Pits, Ponds and Lagoons No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.", "6.2.9": " 6.2.9 Stressed Vegetation No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.", "6.2.10": " 6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.", "6.3": " 6.3 Non-ASTM Services", "6.3.1": " 6.3.1 Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) which is a blend of Colorado River water and water from the northern State Water Project as well as groundwater pumped from local deep wells in the Central Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon and the 2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.  Water sampling was not conducted to verify water quality.", "6.3.5": " 6.3.5 Microbial Growth Microbial growths are microscopic organisms found virtually everywhere, indoors and outdoors. Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should not be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property. Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings. No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner\u2019s visual assessment.", "6.4": " 6.4 Adjacent Property Reconnaissance The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The subject property lies at an approximate elevation of 161 feet above mean sea level (msl) with a local topographic gradient toward the southeast. A copy of the most recent topographic map is included as Figure 3.", "2.4.2": " 2.4.2 Hydrology According to information obtained from the State Water Resources Control Board online database, GeoTracker, for a nearby release (Case Number T0603767053 \u2013 4477 East Shelia Street) and topographic map interpretation, groundwater in the vicinity of the subject property is present at depth of 112 to 115 feet bgs and flows toward the south-southeast. The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  According to Community Panel Number 06037C1643F, dated September 26, 2008, the subject property appears to be located in Zone X, an area located outside of the 100-year and 500- year flood plains."}, "3": {"3.0": " 3.0 HISTORICAL INFORMATION Partner obtained historical use information about the subject property from a variety of sources.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity.

A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property.

Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.

The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.

No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.  An HREC were identified. Based on the conclusions of this assessment, Partner has no recommendations for further assessment at this time."}, "8": {"8.0": " 8.0 SIGNATURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the property located at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California in conformance with the scope and limitations of the protocol and the limitations stated earlier in this report.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Based on the regulatory status and lack of listing in other databases indicating violations and/or a release, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that this listing does not represent an environmental concern to the subject property. Based on the findings, vapor migration is not expected to represent a significant environmental concern at this time.", "4.2.4": " 4.2.4 Site Vicinity Partner reviewed the EDR database report to identify offsite facilities that have suspected or documented environmental concerns or RECs that may negatively impact the subject property.  Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

PCBs in electrical equipment are controlled by United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under the regulations, there are three categories into which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs \u2013 \u201cNon-PCB;\u201d 2) 50 ppm-500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Contaminated;\u201d and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Containing.\u201d  The manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad- mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer. No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner\u2019s reconnaissance.", "6.2.5": " 6.2.5 Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.6": " 6.2.6 Pools of Liquid No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.7": " 6.2.7 Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.8": " 6.2.8 Pits, Ponds and Lagoons No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.", "6.2.9": " 6.2.9 Stressed Vegetation No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.", "6.2.10": " 6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.", "6.3": " 6.3 Non-ASTM Services", "6.3.1": " 6.3.1 Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) which is a blend of Colorado River water and water from the northern State Water Project as well as groundwater pumped from local deep wells in the Central Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon and the 2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.  Water sampling was not conducted to verify water quality.", "6.3.5": " 6.3.5 Microbial Growth Microbial growths are microscopic organisms found virtually everywhere, indoors and outdoors. Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should not be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property. Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings. No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner\u2019s visual assessment.", "6.4": " 6.4 Adjacent Property Reconnaissance The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.  An HREC were identified.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.

(September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

PCBs in electrical equipment are controlled by United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under the regulations, there are three categories into which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs \u2013 \u201cNon-PCB;\u201d 2) 50 ppm-500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Contaminated;\u201d and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Containing.\u201d  The manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad- mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer. No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner\u2019s reconnaissance.", "6.2.5": " 6.2.5 Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.6": " 6.2.6 Pools of Liquid No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.7": " 6.2.7 Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.8": " 6.2.8 Pits, Ponds and Lagoons No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.", "6.2.9": " 6.2.9 Stressed Vegetation No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.", "6.2.10": " 6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.", "6.3": " 6.3 Non-ASTM Services", "6.3.1": " 6.3.1 Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) which is a blend of Colorado River water and water from the northern State Water Project as well as groundwater pumped from local deep wells in the Central Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon and the 2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.

Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should not be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property. Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings. No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner\u2019s visual assessment.", "6.4": " 6.4 Adjacent Property Reconnaissance The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.

The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property.

Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.

The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.

No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.  An HREC were identified. Based on the conclusions of this assessment, Partner has no recommendations for further assessment at this time."}, "8": {"8.0": " 8.0 SIGNATURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the property located at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California in conformance with the scope and limitations of the protocol and the limitations stated earlier in this report.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Based on the regulatory status and lack of listing in other databases indicating violations and/or a release, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that this listing does not represent an environmental concern to the subject property. Based on the findings, vapor migration is not expected to represent a significant environmental concern at this time.", "4.2.4": " 4.2.4 Site Vicinity Partner reviewed the EDR database report to identify offsite facilities that have suspected or documented environmental concerns or RECs that may negatively impact the subject property.  Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

PCBs in electrical equipment are controlled by United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under the regulations, there are three categories into which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs \u2013 \u201cNon-PCB;\u201d 2) 50 ppm-500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Contaminated;\u201d and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Containing.\u201d  The manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad- mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer. No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner\u2019s reconnaissance.", "6.2.5": " 6.2.5 Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.6": " 6.2.6 Pools of Liquid No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.7": " 6.2.7 Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.8": " 6.2.8 Pits, Ponds and Lagoons No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.", "6.2.9": " 6.2.9 Stressed Vegetation No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.", "6.2.10": " 6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.", "6.3": " 6.3 Non-ASTM Services", "6.3.1": " 6.3.1 Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) which is a blend of Colorado River water and water from the northern State Water Project as well as groundwater pumped from local deep wells in the Central Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon and the 2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.  Water sampling was not conducted to verify water quality.", "6.3.5": " 6.3.5 Microbial Growth Microbial growths are microscopic organisms found virtually everywhere, indoors and outdoors. Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should not be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property. Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings. No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner\u2019s visual assessment.", "6.4": " 6.4 Adjacent Property Reconnaissance The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.  An HREC were identified.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.

(September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

PCBs in electrical equipment are controlled by United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under the regulations, there are three categories into which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs \u2013 \u201cNon-PCB;\u201d 2) 50 ppm-500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Contaminated;\u201d and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Containing.\u201d  The manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad- mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer. No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner\u2019s reconnaissance.", "6.2.5": " 6.2.5 Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.6": " 6.2.6 Pools of Liquid No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.7": " 6.2.7 Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.8": " 6.2.8 Pits, Ponds and Lagoons No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.", "6.2.9": " 6.2.9 Stressed Vegetation No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.", "6.2.10": " 6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.", "6.3": " 6.3 Non-ASTM Services", "6.3.1": " 6.3.1 Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) which is a blend of Colorado River water and water from the northern State Water Project as well as groundwater pumped from local deep wells in the Central Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon and the 2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.

Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should not be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property. Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings. No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner\u2019s visual assessment.", "6.4": " 6.4 Adjacent Property Reconnaissance The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.

The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property.

Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.

The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.

No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.  An HREC were identified. Based on the conclusions of this assessment, Partner has no recommendations for further assessment at this time."}, "8": {"8.0": " 8.0 SIGNATURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the property located at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California in conformance with the scope and limitations of the protocol and the limitations stated earlier in this report.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Based on the regulatory status and lack of listing in other databases indicating violations and/or a release, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that this listing does not represent an environmental concern to the subject property. Based on the findings, vapor migration is not expected to represent a significant environmental concern at this time.", "4.2.4": " 4.2.4 Site Vicinity Partner reviewed the EDR database report to identify offsite facilities that have suspected or documented environmental concerns or RECs that may negatively impact the subject property.  Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

PCBs in electrical equipment are controlled by United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under the regulations, there are three categories into which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs \u2013 \u201cNon-PCB;\u201d 2) 50 ppm-500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Contaminated;\u201d and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Containing.\u201d  The manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad- mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer. No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner\u2019s reconnaissance.", "6.2.5": " 6.2.5 Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.6": " 6.2.6 Pools of Liquid No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.7": " 6.2.7 Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.8": " 6.2.8 Pits, Ponds and Lagoons No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.", "6.2.9": " 6.2.9 Stressed Vegetation No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.", "6.2.10": " 6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.", "6.3": " 6.3 Non-ASTM Services", "6.3.1": " 6.3.1 Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) which is a blend of Colorado River water and water from the northern State Water Project as well as groundwater pumped from local deep wells in the Central Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon and the 2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.  Water sampling was not conducted to verify water quality.", "6.3.5": " 6.3.5 Microbial Growth Microbial growths are microscopic organisms found virtually everywhere, indoors and outdoors. Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should not be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property. Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings. No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner\u2019s visual assessment.", "6.4": " 6.4 Adjacent Property Reconnaissance The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.  An HREC were identified.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.

(September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

PCBs in electrical equipment are controlled by United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under the regulations, there are three categories into which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs \u2013 \u201cNon-PCB;\u201d 2) 50 ppm-500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Contaminated;\u201d and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Containing.\u201d  The manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad- mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer. No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner\u2019s reconnaissance.", "6.2.5": " 6.2.5 Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.6": " 6.2.6 Pools of Liquid No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.7": " 6.2.7 Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.8": " 6.2.8 Pits, Ponds and Lagoons No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.", "6.2.9": " 6.2.9 Stressed Vegetation No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.", "6.2.10": " 6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.", "6.3": " 6.3 Non-ASTM Services", "6.3.1": " 6.3.1 Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) which is a blend of Colorado River water and water from the northern State Water Project as well as groundwater pumped from local deep wells in the Central Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon and the 2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.

Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should not be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property. Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings. No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner\u2019s visual assessment.", "6.4": " 6.4 Adjacent Property Reconnaissance The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.

The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property.

Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.

The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.

No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.  An HREC were identified. Based on the conclusions of this assessment, Partner has no recommendations for further assessment at this time."}, "8": {"8.0": " 8.0 SIGNATURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the property located at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California in conformance with the scope and limitations of the protocol and the limitations stated earlier in this report.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Based on the regulatory status and lack of listing in other databases indicating violations and/or a release, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that this listing does not represent an environmental concern to the subject property. Based on the findings, vapor migration is not expected to represent a significant environmental concern at this time.", "4.2.4": " 4.2.4 Site Vicinity Partner reviewed the EDR database report to identify offsite facilities that have suspected or documented environmental concerns or RECs that may negatively impact the subject property.  Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

PCBs in electrical equipment are controlled by United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under the regulations, there are three categories into which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs \u2013 \u201cNon-PCB;\u201d 2) 50 ppm-500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Contaminated;\u201d and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Containing.\u201d  The manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad- mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer. No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner\u2019s reconnaissance.", "6.2.5": " 6.2.5 Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.6": " 6.2.6 Pools of Liquid No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.7": " 6.2.7 Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.8": " 6.2.8 Pits, Ponds and Lagoons No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.", "6.2.9": " 6.2.9 Stressed Vegetation No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.", "6.2.10": " 6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.", "6.3": " 6.3 Non-ASTM Services", "6.3.1": " 6.3.1 Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) which is a blend of Colorado River water and water from the northern State Water Project as well as groundwater pumped from local deep wells in the Central Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon and the 2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.  Water sampling was not conducted to verify water quality.", "6.3.5": " 6.3.5 Microbial Growth Microbial growths are microscopic organisms found virtually everywhere, indoors and outdoors. Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should not be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property. Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings. No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner\u2019s visual assessment.", "6.4": " 6.4 Adjacent Property Reconnaissance The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.  An HREC were identified.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.

(September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

PCBs in electrical equipment are controlled by United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under the regulations, there are three categories into which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs \u2013 \u201cNon-PCB;\u201d 2) 50 ppm-500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Contaminated;\u201d and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Containing.\u201d  The manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad- mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer. No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner\u2019s reconnaissance.", "6.2.5": " 6.2.5 Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.6": " 6.2.6 Pools of Liquid No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.7": " 6.2.7 Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.8": " 6.2.8 Pits, Ponds and Lagoons No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.", "6.2.9": " 6.2.9 Stressed Vegetation No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.", "6.2.10": " 6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.", "6.3": " 6.3 Non-ASTM Services", "6.3.1": " 6.3.1 Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) which is a blend of Colorado River water and water from the northern State Water Project as well as groundwater pumped from local deep wells in the Central Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon and the 2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.

Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should not be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property. Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings. No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner\u2019s visual assessment.", "6.4": " 6.4 Adjacent Property Reconnaissance The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.

The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property.

Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.

The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.

No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.  An HREC were identified. Based on the conclusions of this assessment, Partner has no recommendations for further assessment at this time."}, "8": {"8.0": " 8.0 SIGNATURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the property located at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California in conformance with the scope and limitations of the protocol and the limitations stated earlier in this report.

(Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.", "1.1": " 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a79601) liability (hereinafter, the \u201clandowner liability protections,\u201d or \u201cLLPs\u201d).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 constitutes \u201call appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice\u201d as defined at 42 U.S.C. \u00a79601(35)(B). In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields Amendments), the User must provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional.  Failure to provide this information could result in a determination that all appropriate inquiry is not complete.  The user is asked to provide information or knowledge of the following: \u2022 Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the site. \u2022 Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a registry. \u2022 Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the LLPs. \u2022 Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it were not contaminated. \u2022 Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property. \u2022 The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate assessment. \u2022 The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA. Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA liability. Partner requested our Client to provide information to satisfy User Responsibilities as identified in Section 6 of the ASTM guidance.", "1.2": " 1.2 Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated October 14, 2013. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments in order to request for review records of current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Partner researched information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at the appropriate agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment.  These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on the property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or radon.", "1.3": " 1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.", "1.4": " 1.4 User Reliance Reliance on this report by the client and all authorized parties will be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and its assigns. Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents, successors and assigns may rely upon this report in evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be secured by the subject property.  This report may also be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender extending credit to be secured by the subject property (the credit to be extended by Bank of America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred to as the \u201cMortgage Loan\u201d) and (b) any actual or prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer of the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any rating agency actually or prospectively rating any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any institutional provider (s) from time to time of any liquidity facility or credit support for such financing.  In addition, this report or a reference to this report may be included or quoted in any offering circular, private placement memorandum, registration statement or prospectus and Partner Engineering and Science agrees to cooperate in answering questions by any of the above parties in connection with a securitization or transaction involving the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof) and/or such securities. This report has no other purpose and should not be relied upon by any other person or entity.", "1.5": " 1.5 Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all of the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM E1527-13. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: \u2022 Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained from other historical sources (as discussed in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on the use by tenants as office space this limitation does not alter the findings of this assessment. \u2022 An environmental cleanup lien search was not performed.  However, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that the lack of the lien search does not represent a significant data gap, in that it does not impact Partner\u2019s ability to identify recognized environmental conditions at the subject property and therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this report.  According to the Title Commitment and EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental liens are not associated with the subject property.  A title report provided by LBA did not indicate environmental liens filed against the property.  Based on available information, no environmental liens appear to be associated with the subject property."}, "2": {"2.0": " 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION", "2.1": " 2.1 Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California is located on the southwestern intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue.

The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is the Los Angeles River located approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed on the subject property during this assessment.", "2.4.3": " 2.4.3 Geology/Soils The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a northwest- southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by similarly trending faults.  They extend from the Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja California and are bounded on the east by the Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The Peninsular Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine sediments. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on floodplains and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a combination of soils that are so intermingled that they cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils cannot be determined.", "2.4.4": " 2.4.4 Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Based on the regulatory status and lack of listing in other databases indicating violations and/or a release, it is Partner\u2019s opinion that this listing does not represent an environmental concern to the subject property. Based on the findings, vapor migration is not expected to represent a significant environmental concern at this time.", "4.2.4": " 4.2.4 Site Vicinity Partner reviewed the EDR database report to identify offsite facilities that have suspected or documented environmental concerns or RECs that may negatively impact the subject property.  Partner\u2019s criteria for further evaluating the potential impact of a listed offsite facility are summarized below: \u2022 The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a likely pathway exists for known releases of environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the subject property; or, contaminants from the listed offsite facility can reach the subject through other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, \u2022 The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one of the following databases: Federal NPL, Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and State-Specific lists including, but not limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL, State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or \u2022 The facility is a known or suspected concern based on Partner\u2019s experience or observations made during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning operations that may or may not be listed as RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to have a remediation system in place). Based on a review of previous reports and information obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient facilities in the site vicinity are identified with open and closed release cases that have impacted groundwater.  The following facilities have an open release case: \u2022 Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at 4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. This site reported a release from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile organic compounds (including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10, 2003, which impacted soil and groundwater. The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB). The LUST case is listed as \u201cOpen-Site Assessment\u201d as of September 19, 2008.  Based on review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a cleanup and abatement order to the property owner.  Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring report, groundwater beneath this facility has been impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring wells are located within Shelia Street (across the railroad tracks to the north of the subject property). The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 \u00b5g/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted groundwater is moving south-southeast and would likely pass east of the subject property, not under it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115 feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing to take corrective action in response to the unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater (last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension was request by Weld-It Company on September 26, 2018. \u2022 Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject property. The facility is listed on the Los Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC, EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available information obtained on Envirostor, the site has historically been utilized as a plating facility from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck rims and bumpers for a period of four years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released into the soil. The release was presumably a result of onsite activities. The RWQCB provided oversight for sampling and remediation activities conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The RWQCB issued a \"No Further Action\" for soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE contaminated perched groundwater was identified at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared that groundwater underlying the site may have not been adequately investigated and the case status is listed as \u201cInactive \u2013Action Required\u201d as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further information available. Based on the regulatory status, these listings have the potential to impact the groundwater in the site vicinity. Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject property was a groundwater contaminant source.", "4.2.5": " 4.2.5 Unmapped Sites Partner reviewed EDR\u2019s Orphan Summary, which is a listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on lack of sufficient data regarding their exact location within the general area.

(December 20, 2017) Asbestos Operations & Maintenance Program, Environmental Program Management (January 2017) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 18-255102.1, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (September 10, 2018) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, California 90058, Partner Project Number: 20-291231.55, Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and Phase II Investigation Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site, a former truck repair shed used solely for storage on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on the north side of site. The subject property was occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.  Site operations included receiving and storage of products prior to pick up and distribution by various clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid, other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics, and various items such as wood chips and limestone.  Floors within the former truck maintenance area were observed to be heavily stained. Hazardous substances observed at the subject property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine coolant, urea solution, \u201cPVC powder\u201d, and plastic materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not used onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and limited solvents and paint-related materials. The site manager reported that minor spills that occurred previously were confined to the warehouse interior and were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately. According to City of Vernon Building Department (CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000- gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the northwest corner of the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination was identified that required remediation prior to installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab results reportedly indicated satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the use of the remediated soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation related to the former USTs was identified. No laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency closure letters were identified in CVBD files. According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4\u2019X30\u2019 overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An attached figure depicts the septic tank and three seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast side of the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from the existing warehouse. No further information was identified regarding the septic tank and associated seepage pits. On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for cyanide. Analytical results indicated: \u2022 None of the analyzed soil samples contained detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were detected in any of the analyzed soil samples above applicable regulatory guidelines. \u2022 Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded background concentrations, but did not exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was detected above screening levels in one soil sample, but did not exceed typical background concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No other metals were detected in the analyzed soil samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs and/or typical background concentrations. \u2022 None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in soil exceeded applicable screening levels. The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the northwestern portion of the subject property to the north of the current truck repair bays. The location and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the location of the former USTs.  No large metallic features were identified within either anomaly, which confirms that the USTs have been removed and no additional USTs were installed. Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs were installed on-site after the removal and remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition, there did not appear to be residual impacts as a result of the removal of the two former USTs and the staining and potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively impacting the subject property at that time. Partner recommended no further investigation with respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair bays/staining, or the former septic system at that time. In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. According to these reports, the program is designed to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. These reports outline the implemented management practices including training activities, renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic surveillance, etc. In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of LBA RVI \u2013 Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 assessment, the subject building was vacant and undergoing renovations. Renovations include demolition of the former truck repair shed and guard shack, removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space (northeast corner of the building) and four new restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was observed crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is located adjacent to the south side of the building. No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts was removed on the east side of the property as part of current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the northwest corner of the subject property. In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest corner of the property was removed.  In November 2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the paved surface in the former truck repair shed located on the northwest corner of the property.  The former truck repair shed was removed as part of current renovation activities. No drains were observed in the truck repair shed at the time of removal. Partner identified the following HRECs and environmental issues: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. \u2022 Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there was potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. Partner recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program. Partner recommended no further investigation. In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA Report for the subject property. At the time of the site visit, the subject property was developed with the existing office/warehouse building on the south side of the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO, an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site operations included offices, warehouse/equipment storage, and equipment maintenance activities. No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of hazardous substances was observed on the subject property. No evidence of current aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was observed during the site reconnaissance. The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. Partner recommended no further investigation.

PCBs in electrical equipment are controlled by United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under the regulations, there are three categories into which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs \u2013 \u201cNon-PCB;\u201d 2) 50 ppm-500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Contaminated;\u201d and, 3) Greater than 500 ppm \u2013 \u201cPCB-Containing.\u201d  The manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad- mounted transformer was observed on the subject property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in the vicinity of the transformer. No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts, dock levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was observed on the subject property during Partner\u2019s reconnaissance.", "6.2.5": " 6.2.5 Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.6": " 6.2.6 Pools of Liquid No pools of liquid were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.7": " 6.2.7 Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those associated with storm water removal, were observed on the subject property during the site reconnaissance.", "6.2.8": " 6.2.8 Pits, Ponds and Lagoons No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the subject property.", "6.2.9": " 6.2.9 Stressed Vegetation No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject property.", "6.2.10": " 6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards No additional environmental hazards, including landfill activities or radiological hazards, were observed.", "6.3": " 6.3 Non-ASTM Services", "6.3.1": " 6.3.1 Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their useful properties such as thermal insulation, chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile strength.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation.  Construction materials including, but not limited to, thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building and that have not been appropriately tested may be considered \u201cpresumed asbestos-containing material\u201d (PACM). The subject property building was constructed in 1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tiles Throughout Building Interior No Good Floor Tile Mastic Throughout Building Interior No Good Ceiling Tiles Throughout Building Interior Yes Good Roofing Materials Roof No Not Observed The limited visual survey consisted of noting observable materials (materials which were readily accessible and visible during the course of the site reconnaissance) that are commonly known to potentially contain asbestos. According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the construction materials within this facility, a comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program.", "6.3.2": " 6.3.2 Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject property, LBP was not considered within the scope of this assessment.", "6.3.3": " 6.3.3 Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based upon the radon zone classification, radon is not considered to be a significant environmental concern.", "6.3.4": " 6.3.4 Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works Water & Development Services serves the subject property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly beneath the subject property is not utilized for domestic purposes.  The sources of public water for the City of Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) which is a blend of Colorado River water and water from the northern State Water Project as well as groundwater pumped from local deep wells in the Central Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon and the 2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper.  Water sampling was not conducted to verify water quality.", "6.3.5": " 6.3.5 Microbial Growth Microbial growths are microscopic organisms found virtually everywhere, indoors and outdoors. Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the subject property building for significant evidence of microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should not be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection.  This limited assessment was not designed to assess all areas of potential microbial growth that may be affected by microbial growth on the subject property. Rather, it is intended to give the client an indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on observed areas) microbial growth is present at the subject property. This evaluation did not include a review of pipe chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed walls and ceilings. No obvious indications of water damage or microbial growth were observed during Partner\u2019s visual assessment.", "6.4": " 6.4 Adjacent Property Reconnaissance The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjacent properties from the subject property premises.  No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjacent properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards."}, "7": {"7.0": " 7.0 FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. \u2022 Partner did not identify RECs during the course of this assessment. A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of this assessment. A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical survey and a Phase II Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the location of former on-site UST tankholds and to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former septic system, and former storage of cyanide products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with agency involvement, the geophysical survey, and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic system, and storage of cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further action is considered necessary. An environmental issue refers to environmental concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify as RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The following was identified during the course of this assessment: \u2022 Partner did not identify environmental issues during the course of this assessment. Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East 26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the \u201csubject property\u201d).  Any exceptions to or deletions from this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.  An HREC were identified.
