EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (Partner) has
performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment 
(ESA) in accordance with the scope of work and
limitations of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13, the 
Environmental Protection Agency Standards and
Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR
Part 
312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th
Street in the City of Vernon, Los Angeles County,
California 
(the “subject property”).  The Scope of Services
performed is in accordance with the contract between
LBA 
Realty, LLC (LBA) and Partner dated October 14, 2013.
  
Property Description 
The subject property is located on the southwest
corner of the intersection of East 26th Street and  
Ayers Avenue within an industrial area of Vernon, Los
Angeles County, California.  Please refer to the

Site Assessment Conducted On: 
October 28, 2021 
The subject property is currently occupied by
JSource, a sub-tenant of ACCO (HVAC equipment and 
installation company).  Onsite operations consist of
the warehousing and distribution of various consumer 
merchandises.  An office area and a loading dock were
located on the northeast corner and north side of 
the building.  In addition to the current structure,
the subject property is improved with paved parking 
area and fencing.  Access to the subject property is
provided via an entrance along Ayers Avenue. 
No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of
hazardous substances was observed on the subject 
property.  Small quantities of retail cleaning
products and general maintenance supplies were found
to be 
properly labeled and stored at the time of the
assessment with no signs of leaks, stains, or spills.
 The 
storage and use of maintenance supplies does not
appear to pose a significant threat to the 
environmental integrity of the subject property at
this time.  No evidence of current aboveground
storage 
tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) was
observed during the site reconnaissance.   
According to review of available historical data, it
appears that the subject property was agriculturally 
developed land from 1928 to at least 1938.  Aerial
photography and a 1950 Sanborn map indicate that by 
1948 a lumber yard was operated onsite on the
southern half of the property.  By 1964 the current

In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and
Phase II Investigation Report for the subject 
property. At the time of the site visit, the subject
property was developed with the existing 
office/warehouse building on the south side of the
site, a former truck repair shed used solely for
storage 
on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on
the north side of site. The subject property was 
occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility.
Site operations included receiving and storage of 
products prior to pick up and distribution by various
clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed 
mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid,
other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics,
and 
assorted items such as wood chips and limestone. 
Floors within the former truck maintenance area were 
observed to be heavily stained. 
In 2017 hazardous substances observed at the subject
property included hydraulic, transmission, brake, 
and multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine
coolant, urea solution, “PVC powder”, and plastic 
materials, stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon
buckets, and 10-liter two-packs.  Urea solution and
engine 
coolant were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes,
primarily on the loading dock.  These items were not 
used onsite.  According to the site manager,
approximately 20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased
storing 
hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and
limited solvents and paint-related materials. The
site 
manager reported that minor spills that occurred
previously were confined to the warehouse interior
and 
were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately.
  
According to City of Vernon Building Department
(CVBD) records, in 1980, two underground storage 
tanks (USTs) including a 5,000-gallon gasoline and a
10,000-gallon diesel USTs were installed at the 
subject property.  The two USTs and an adjacent fuel
dispenser were located on the northwest corner of 
the subject property, north of the truck repair shed.
 In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was issued to remove 
two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 10,000-gallon
diesel), lines, wells, and pipes and install one
modern

welded 20,000-gallon plasteel tank and piping. It was
noted that between 1988 and 1991, soil samples 
were taken, and contamination was identified that
required remediation prior to installation of the new
tank. Soil contamination was excavated to clean soil
(depth not provided). Lab results reportedly
indicated 
satisfactory remediation. The Vernon Health
Department reportedly authorized the use of the
remediated 
soil as backfill for the excavation.  It is unclear
if a new tank was installed.  No other documentation 
related to the former USTs was identified. No
laboratory data, remediation reports, or agency
closure 
letters were identified in CVBD files. 
According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4’X30’
overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject 
property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to
an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An 
attached figure depicts the septic tank and three
seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast
side of 
the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated
that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from
the 
existing warehouse. No further information was
identified regarding the septic tank and associated 
seepage pits. 
On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II
Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to 
evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former
tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the
potential 
impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) to soil in the vicinity of the 
former UST, the truck maintenance area, former septic
system, and former storage of cyanide products.  
The scope of the Phase II Subsurface Investigation
included a geophysical survey and seven soil borings.
 
Nineteen soil samples were analyzed for total
petroleum hydrocarbons total carbon chain (TPH-cc)
and 
VOCs, four soil samples were analyzed for CAM 17
Metals, and two soil samples were analyzed for 
cyanide.   
Analytical results indicated:  
• 
None of the analyzed soil samples contained
detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above 
laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable
regulatory guidelines. 
• 
None of the detected concentrations of toluene,
ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded 
applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were
detected in any of the analyzed soil samples 
above applicable regulatory guidelines. 
• 
Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded
background concentrations, but did not 
exceed applicable screening levels. Arsenic was
detected above screening levels in one soil 
sample, but did not exceed typical background
concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of 
arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No
other metals were detected in the analyzed soil 
samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs
and/or typical background concentrations. 
• 
None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in
soil exceeded applicable screening levels. 
The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the
northwestern portion of the subject property to the 
north of the current truck repair bays. The location
and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a 
backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the
location of the former USTs.  No large metallic
features 
 
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment 
Project No. 21-342562.35 
November 15, 2021 
Page iv 
were identified within either anomaly, which confirms
that the USTs have been removed and no additional 
USTs were installed. 
Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs
were installed on-site after the removal and 
remediation of the two former USTs.  The analytical
data indicated that residual impacts as a result of
the 
removal of the two former USTs and the staining and
potential septic tank did not appear to be negatively
impacting the subject property.  Partner recommended
no further investigation with respect to the former 
USTs, the current truck repair bays/ staining, or the
former septic system. 
The agency database report obtained from
Environmental Data Resources, Inc. (EDR) identified
the subject 
property as: 
• 
ACCO Engineered Systems (EDR Map ID: A1), is
identified on the CERS database.  The facility is 
identified as a chemical storage facility.  Minor
violations, administrative in nature (failure to 
submit a hazardous materials business plan), were
issued in 2014 and 2015.   
• 
F&S Distribution (EDR Map ID: A3, A5, A8, A10, A11,
A13, A16), is identified on the SWEEPS UST, 
FINDS, FTTS, HIST FTTS, HIST UST, NPDES, Waste
Discharge System (WDS), ECHO, HWTS, and 
HAZNET databases.  The SWEEPS UST and HIST UST
databases identified two USTs including 
5,000-gallon regular gasoline UST and 10,000-gallon
diesel UST, installed in 1980.  No removal 
dates were provided.  The facility is identified on
the HAZNET database for generating state-
regulated wastes including “other organic solids and
off-specification, aged, or surplus organics” 
that were manifested for off-site disposal in 1997
and 1998. The FINDS database identified the 
facility as a TSCA Submitter.  As discussed in
Section 4.1.3, according to City of Vernon EHD 
records reviewed by Partner, in March 1994, the
facility was reportedly warehousing about 
120,000 pounds of sodium cyanide every 3 to 4 months.
The facility discontinued warehousing 
the sodium cyanide to avoid being required to prepare
a RMPP.  By May 24, 1994, the cyanide 
was no longer onsite. 
• 
LBA Realty (EDR Map ID: A4), is identified on the
HAZNET and HWTS databases. This facility is 
listed in the HAZNET database for generating state-
regulated wastes including “Asbestos 
containing waste” that were manifested for off-site
disposal in 2018. Based on the regulatory 
status and lack of listings in other databases
indicating violations and/or a release, this listing
is 
not considered to have created an environmental
concern to the subject property. 
• 
ACTEO Corporation (EDR Map ID: A6, A7), is identified
on the CERS, HAZNET and HWTS 
databases. This facility is identified on the HAZNET
database for generating state-regulated 
wastes including “laboratory waste and off-
specification, aged, or surplus organics” that were 
manifested for off-site disposal in 2000 and 2001.   
• 
H&S Marketing (EDR Map ID: A9), is identified on the
HIST UST, HWTS, and HAZNET databases.  
No information is listed on the HIST UST database. 
The facility is identified on the HAZNET 
database for generating state-regulated wastes
including “off-specification, aged, or surplus 
organics” that were manifested for off-site disposal
in 2010.

• 
Witco Corp. (EDR Map ID: A2, A12, A14, A18), is
identified on the RCRA-SQG, ECHO, FINDS, 
HWTS, and HAZNET databases. The facility is
identified on the HAZNET database for generating 
state-regulated wastes including “pesticides and
other waste associated with pesticide 
production, other organic solids, liquids w/pH<=2,
and off-specification, aged, or surplus 
organics” that were manifested for off-site disposal
in 1998.   
• 
California Transport (EDR Map ID: A15, A17), is
identified on the RCRA-SQG, FINDS, ECHO, and 
HAZNET databases.  No RCRA violations were listed.
RCRA Code D039 (tetrachloroethylene) was 
listed. The facility is identified on the HAZNET
database for generating state-regulated wastes 
including “aqueous solution with total organic
residues less than 10 percent” that were 
manifested for off-site disposal between 2011 and
2014.   
Based on the information provided in the EDR Database
report and results of the Phase II investigation 
(see Section 5.2.6), these listings are not
considered to have the potential to create an
environmental 
concern at the subject property.  
Online data was reviewed for two upgradient
facilities with the potential to impact the
groundwater in the site 
vicinity (See Section 4.2.4).  Based on distance from
the listed sites and depth to groundwater, vapor
intrusion 
is considered to be unlikely.  Partner found no
evidence that the subject property was a groundwater 
contaminant source.   
The subject property is located within an industrial
area. During the vicinity reconnaissance, Partner 
observed the following land use on properties in the
immediate vicinity of the subject property:   
Immediately Surrounding Properties 
North: 
East 26th Street, followed by Atchison Topeka and
Santa Fe Railroad and railroad yard. 
South: 
Abandoned railroad spur, followed by Dollar Empire
(4425-4429 Bandini Boulevard) and 
Bakery Depot Inc. (4489 Bandini Boulevard).  
East: 
Ayers Avenue, followed by BNSF – Lot 11 (4560 East
26th Street) and classic Concepts (4505 
Bandini Boulevard).  
West: 
Peerless Materials Company (4442 East 26th Street). 
No environmental concerns associated with adjacent
properties were identified based on visual 
observation from publicly accessible rights-of-way. 
No potential vapor intrusion concerns were identified
onsite nor from offsite facilities.  
According to information obtained from the State
Water Resources Control Board online database, 
GeoTracker, for a nearby release (Case Number
T0603767053 – 4477 East Shelia Street) and
topographic 
map interpretation, groundwater in the vicinity of
the subject property is present at depth of 112 to
115 
feet bgs and flows toward the south-southeast.

Findings 
A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to
the presence or likely presence of any hazardous 
substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a
property: due to release to the environment; under 
conditions indicative of a release to the
environment; or under conditions that pose a material
threat of a 
future release to the environment.   
• 
Partner did not identify RECs during the course of
this assessment. 
A controlled recognized environmental condition
(CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release
of 
hazardous substances or petroleum products that has
been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable 
regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or
petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject
to the implementation of required controls.  The
following was identified during the course of this 
assessment:   
• 
Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of
this assessment. 
A historical recognized environmental condition
(HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous 
substances or petroleum products that has occurred in
connection with the property and has been 
addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable
regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use
criteria 
established by a regulatory authority, without
subjecting the property to any required controls. 
The 
following was identified during the course of this
assessment:   
• 
In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical
survey and a Phase II Subsurface 
Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the
location of former on-site UST tankholds and 
to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum
hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the 
former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former
septic system, and former storage of cyanide 
products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with
agency involvement, the geophysical survey, 
and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck
maintenance area, septic system, and storage of 
cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further
action is considered necessary.  
An environmental issue refers to environmental
concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify
as 
RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The
following was identified during the course of this 
assessment: 
• 
Partner did not identify environmental issues during
the course of this assessment. 
Conclusions, Opinions and Recommendations 
Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment in conformance with the scope and 
limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-13 of 4444 East
26th Street, Vernon, Los Angeles County, California 
(the “subject property”).  Any exceptions to or
deletions from this practice are described in Section
1.5 of 
this report. 
This assessment has revealed no evidence of
recognized environmental conditions in connection
with the 
subject property.  An HREC were identified. Based on
the conclusions of this assessment, Partner has no 
recommendations for further assessment at this time.

INTRODUCTION 
Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (Partner) has
performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment 
(ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations
of ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and the 
Environmental Protection Agency Standards and
Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR
Part 
312) for the property located at 4444 East 26th
Street in Vernon, Los Angeles County, California (the
“subject property”).  Any exceptions to, or deletions
from, this scope of work are described in the report.
1.1 
Purpose 
The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or
potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as 
defined by ASTM Standard E-1527-13) affecting the
subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a 
material violation or a potential material violation
of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any 
material constraints on the operation of the subject
property or require a material change in the use 
thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or
other response with respect to Hazardous Substances
or 
Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject
property under any applicable environmental law; 4)
may 
affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may
require specific actions to be performed with regard 
to such conditions and circumstances.   
This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy
one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent 
landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide
prospective purchaser limitations on scope of 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. §9601) 
liability (hereinafter, the “landowner liability
protections,” or “LLPs”).  ASTM Standard E-1527-13 
constitutes “all appropriate inquiry into the
previous ownership and uses of the property
consistent with 
good commercial or customary practice” as defined at
42 U.S.C. §9601(35)(B). 
In order to qualify for one of the LLPs offered by
the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields 
Revitalization Act of 2001 (the Brownfields
Amendments), the User must provide the following
information 
(if available) to the environmental professional. 
Failure to provide this information could result in a
determination that all appropriate inquiry is not
complete.  The user is asked to provide information
or 
knowledge of the following: 
• 
Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or
recorded against the site. 
• 
Activity and land use limitations that are in place
on the site or that have been filed or recorded in a 
registry. 
• 
Specialized knowledge or experience of the person
seeking to qualify for the LLPs. 
• 
Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market
value of the property if it were not contaminated.   
• 
Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable
information about the property. 
• 
The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely
presence of contamination at the property, and 
the ability to detect the contamination by
appropriate assessment. 
• 
The reason for preparation of this Phase I ESA.

Fulfillment of these user responsibilities is key to
qualification for the identified defenses to CERCLA 
liability. Partner requested our Client to provide
information to satisfy User Responsibilities as
identified in 
Section 6 of the ASTM guidance. 
1.2 
Scope of Work 
The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with
the requirements of ASTM Standard E 1527-13 and 
the contract between LBA Realty and Partner dated
October 14, 2013.   
This assessment included: 1) a property and adjacent
site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key 
personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a
review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review
of a 
regulatory database report provided by a third-party
vendor.  Partner contacted local agencies, such as 
environmental health departments, fire departments
and building departments in order to request for 
review records of current and/or former hazardous
substances usage, storage and/or releases of 
hazardous substances on the subject property.   
Partner researched information on the presence of
activity and use limitations (AULs) at the
appropriate 
agencies.  As defined by ASTM E1527-13, AULs are the
legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the 
use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to
reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous
substances 
or petroleum products in the soil or groundwater on
the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities
that 
could interfere with the effectiveness of a response
action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition
of no significant risk to public health or the
environment.  These legal or physical restrictions,
which may 
include institutional and/or engineering controls
(IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to 
individuals or populations that may be exposed to
hazardous substances and petroleum products in the 
soil or groundwater on the property. 
If requested by Client, this report may also include
the identification, discussion of, and/or limited 
sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs),
lead-based paint (LBP), microbial growth, and/or 
radon. 
1.3 
Limitations 
Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions
contained herein were accomplished in accordance 
with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of
Work.  These methodologies are described as 
representing good commercial and customary practice
for conducting an ESA of a property for the 
purpose of identifying recognized environmental
conditions.  There is a possibility that even with
the 
proper application of these methodologies there may
exist on the subject property conditions that could 
not be identified within the scope of the assessment
or which were not reasonably identifiable from the 
available information.  Partner believes that the
information obtained from the record review and the 
interviews concerning the subject property is
reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not
warrant or 
guarantee that the information provided by these
other sources is accurate or complete.  The
conclusions 
and findings set forth in this report are strictly
limited in time and scope to the date of the
evaluations.  
The conclusions presented in the report are based
solely on the services described therein, and not on 
scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of
agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting 
restraints imposed by the Client.  No other
warranties are implied or expressed.

Some of the information provided in this report is
based upon personal interviews, and research of 
available documents, records, and maps held by the
appropriate government and private agencies.  This 
report is subject to the limitations of historical
documentation, availability, and accuracy of
pertinent 
records, and the personal recollections of those
persons contacted. 
This practice does not address requirements of any
state or local laws or of any federal laws other than
the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs. 
Further, this report does not intend to address all
of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject
property. 
Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of
a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the 
following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking
water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at
the 
subject property and may warrant discussion and/or
assessment; however, are considered non-scope 
issues.  If specifically requested by the Client,
these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3. 
1.4 
User Reliance 
Reliance on this report by the client and all
authorized parties will be subject to the terms,
conditions and 
limitations stated in the Master Services Agreement
(MSA) dated October 14, 2013 between Partner 
Engineering and Science, Inc. and LBA Realty, LLC and
its assigns.   
Bank of America, N. A., its employees, agents,
successors and assigns may rely upon this report in 
evaluating a request for an extension of credit to be
secured by the subject property.  This report may
also 
be used and relied upon by (a) any additional lender
extending credit to be secured by the subject 
property (the credit to be extended by Bank of
America, N.A. and such additional lender is referred
to as 
the “Mortgage Loan”) and (b) any actual or
prospective purchaser, transferee, assignee, or
servicer of the 
Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof), any actual or
prospective investor (including agent or advisor) in 
any securities evidencing a beneficial interest in or
backed by the Mortgage Loan (or any portion thereof),
any rating agency actually or prospectively rating
any such securities, any indenture trustee, and any 
institutional provider (s) from time to time of any
liquidity facility or credit support for such
financing.  In 
addition, this report or a reference to this report
may be included or quoted in any offering circular, 
private placement memorandum, registration statement
or prospectus and Partner Engineering and

1.5 
Limiting Conditions 
The findings and conclusions contain all of the
limitations inherent in these methodologies that are 
referred to in ASTM E1527-13.   
Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are
more specifically set forth below: 
• 
Interviews with past owners, operators and occupants
were not reasonably ascertainable and thus 
constitute a data gap.  Based on information obtained
from other historical sources (as discussed 
in Section 3.0), this data gap is not expected to
alter the findings of this assessment. Partner was 
allowed access to all areas of the building. Based on
the use by tenants as office space this 
limitation does not alter the findings of this
assessment. 
• 
An environmental cleanup lien search was not
performed.  However, it is Partner’s opinion that 
the lack of the lien search does not represent a
significant data gap, in that it does not impact 
Partner’s ability to identify recognized
environmental conditions at the subject property and 
therefore it does not alter the conclusions of this
report.  According to the Title Commitment and 
EDR Report, NPL (Superfund) and other environmental
liens are not associated with the subject 
property.  A title report provided by LBA did not
indicate environmental liens filed against the 
property.  Based on available information, no
environmental liens appear to be associated with 
the subject property.

SITE DESCRIPTION 
2.1 
Site Location and Legal Description 
The subject property at 4444 East 26th Street,
Vernon, California is located on the southwestern 
intersection of East 26th Street and Ayers Avenue. 
The subject property was inspected by Joseph Kim of 
Partner on October 28, 2021.  The weather at the time
of the site visit was sunny and in the mid-70s 
(degrees Fahrenheit). According to the Los Angeles
County Assessor, the subject property is legally 
described as OM 3-19-27 EX OF R/W AND STS LOT 3 DIV
105 REG 48 and is owned by LBA RVI – 
Company VIII, LLC.   
Please refer to Figure 1: Site Location Map, Figure
2: Site Plan, Figure 3: Topographic Map, and Appendix
A: Site Photographs for the location and site
characteristics of the subject property. 
2.2 
Current Property Use 
The subject property is currently occupied by
JSource, a sub-tenant of ACCO (HVAC equipment and 
installation company).  Onsite operations consist of
the warehousing and distribution of various consumer 
merchandises.  An office area and a loading dock were
located on the northeast corner and north side of 
the building.  In addition to the current structure,
the subject property is improved with paved parking 
area and fencing.  Access to the subject property is
provided via an entrance along Ayers Avenue. 
2.3 
Current Use of Adjacent Properties 
The subject property is located within an industrial
area.  During the vicinity reconnaissance, Partner 
observed the following land use on properties in the
immediate vicinity of the subject property: 
Immediately Surrounding Properties 
North: 
East 26th Street, followed by Atchison Topeka and
Santa Fe Railroad and railroad yard. 
South: 
Abandoned railroad spur, followed by Dollar Empire
(4425-4429 Bandini Boulevard) and 
Bakery Depot Inc. (4489 Bandini Boulevard).  
East: 
Ayers Avenue, followed by BNSF – Lot 11 (4560 East
26th Street) and classic Concepts (4505 
Bandini Boulevard).  
West: 
Peerless Materials Company (4442 East 26th Street). 
No environmental concerns associated with adjacent
properties were identified based on visual 
observation from publicly accessible rights-of-way. 
2.4 
Physical Setting Sources 
2.4.1  Topography 
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) Los
Angeles, California Quadrangle 7.5-minute series 
topographic map was reviewed for this ESA.  The
subject property lies at an approximate elevation of
161 
feet above mean sea level (msl) with a local
topographic gradient toward the southeast.  
A copy of the most recent topographic map is included
as Figure 3.

2.4.2 
Hydrology 
According to information obtained from the State
Water Resources Control Board online database, 
GeoTracker, for a nearby release (Case Number
T0603767053 – 4477 East Shelia Street) and
topographic 
map interpretation, groundwater in the vicinity of
the subject property is present at depth of 112 to
115 
feet bgs and flows toward the south-southeast.     
The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the
subject property is the Los Angeles River located 
approximately 2,000 feet southwest of the subject
property.  No settling ponds, lagoons, surface 
impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were
observed on the subject property during this 
assessment.   
2.4.3 
Geology/Soils 
The site is located in the Peninsular Ranges
geomorphic province. The Peninsular Ranges are a
northwest-
southwest oriented complex of blocks separated by
similarly trending faults.  They extend from the 
Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles Basin south to
the Mexican border and beyond to the tip of Baja 
California and are bounded on the east by the
Colorado Desert and the Gulf of California.  The
Peninsular 
Ranges contain minor Jurassic and extensive
Cretaceous igneous rocks associated with the Nevadan 
plutonism.  Marine Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are
well represented, and post-Cretaceous rocks form a 
restricted veneer of volcanic, marine, and nonmarine
sediments.  
Based on information obtained from the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural 
Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online
database, the subject property is mapped as 
Urban land-Biscailuz-Hueneme, drained complex.  The
Biscailuz series consists of very deep, somewhat 
poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from
mixed rock sources. Biscailuz soils are on
floodplains 
and lowlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The
Hueneme soils have grayish brown, loamy fine sand 
and light sandy loam, moderately alkaline A horizons
and stratified, grayish brown, light brownish gray 
and light gray, calcareous C horizons of sandy loams
through sands with thin silt layers, mottled, and 
containing segregated gypsum.  Urban land is a
combination of soils that are so intermingled that
they 
cannot be separately mapped.  The original soils have
been altered by grading, cutting, filling, and 
shaping the ground surface so that the natural soils
cannot be determined. 
2.4.4 
Flood Zone Information 
Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance
Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency.  According to Community Panel
Number 06037C1643F, dated September 26, 2008, 
the subject property appears to be located in Zone X,
an area located outside of the 100-year and 500-
year flood plains.

According to review of available historical data, it
appears that the subject property was agriculturally 
developed land from 1928 to at least 1938.  Aerial
photography and a 1950 Sanborn map indicate that by 
1948 a lumber yard was operated onsite on the
southern half of the property. By 1964 the current 
building was visible on aerial photographs. Since
that time, various commercial/industrial tenants have
occupied the building including:

Common agricultural practices can result in residual
concentrations of fertilizers, pesticides, or
herbicides in 
near-surface soil, though not generally at
concentrations that pose a significant health risk. 
It is Partner’s 
opinion that, since the site has been graded,
redeveloped, and paved, remaining pesticide or
herbicide 
residues, if any, are likely to have been dispersed
during these construction activities and therefore
are 
unlikely to impact human health or the environment. 
Accordingly, no further investigation is recommended 
regarding potential residual pesticide.

Materials Inventory Report, Business/Contingency
Plans, and Hazardous Material License renewal for F&S
Distributing between 1991-2017. F&S Distributing
warehoused and distributed chemicals/hazardous 
materials.   
• 
In June 1991, the Inspection Report noted that many
materials including oil well treating 
compound, sodium hydroxide, bleach, hydrofluoric
acid, ammonium difluoride, propane, 
Carpabon CBL, Mark 565 with stoddard solvent, part
cleaning solvent, motor oil, and waste oil 
were present onsite but not listed on the inventory. 
• 
In March 1994, the facility was reportedly
warehousing about 120,000 pounds of sodium cyanide 
every 3 to 4 months. The facility discontinued
warehousing the sodium cyanide to avoid being 
required to prepare a RMPP.  In May 1994, it was
noted that F&S Distributing was working on 
removing the cyanide.   By May 24, 1994, the cyanide
was no longer onsite.  
• 
In 1997, an Inspection Report noted that F&S
Distributing was ordered to stop discharging 
wastewater with soap along the west side of the
property line.  
• 
In 2003, no USTs were identified onsite.  A propane
500-gallon AST and 200-gallon lubricating oil 
(new & waste) AST were noted.   
No records pertaining to the former USTs were
identified in EHD records.

Environmental Data Resources, Inc. (EDR).  Data from
governmental agency lists are updated and 
integrated into one database, which is updated as
these data are released.  The information contained
in 
this report was compiled from publicly available
sources and the locations of the sites are plotted
utilizing 
a geographic information system, which geocodes the
site addresses.  The accuracy of the geocoded 
locations is approximately +/-300 feet.  Using the
ASTM definition of migration, Partner considers the 
migration of hazardous substances or petroleum
products in any form onto the subject property during
the evaluation of each site listed on the radius
report, which includes solid, liquid, and vapor.  A
copy of 
the EDR report is included as Appendix C.

Subject Property  
The agency database report obtained from
Environmental Data Resources, Inc. (EDR) identified
the subject 
property as: 
• 
ACCO Engineered Systems (EDR Map ID: A1), is
identified on the CERS database.  The facility is 
identified as a chemical storage facility.  Minor
violations, administrative in nature (failure to 
submit a hazardous materials business plan), were
issued in 2014 and 2015.   
• 
F&S Distribution (EDR Map ID: A3, A5, A8, A10, A11,
A13, A16), is identified on the SWEEPS UST, 
FINDS, FTTS, HIST FTTS, HIST UST, NPDES, Waste
Discharge System (WDS), ECHO, HWTS, and 
HAZNET databases.  The SWEEPS UST and HIST UST
databases identified two USTs including 
5,000-gallon regular gasoline UST and 10,000-gallon
diesel UST, installed in 1980.  No removal 
dates were provided.  The facility is identified on
the HAZNET database for generating state-
regulated wastes including “other organic solids and
off-specification, aged, or surplus organics” 
that were manifested for off-site disposal in 1997
and 1998. The FINDS database identified the 
facility as a TSCA Submitter.  As discussed in
Section 4.1.3, according to City of Vernon EHD 
records reviewed by Partner, in March 1994, the
facility was reportedly warehousing about 
120,000 pounds of sodium cyanide every 3 to 4 months.
The facility discontinued warehousing 
the sodium cyanide to avoid being required to prepare
a RMPP.  By May 24, 1994, the cyanide 
was no longer onsite. 
• 
LBA Realty (EDR Map ID: A4), is identified on the
HAZNET and HWTS databases. This facility is 
listed in the HAZNET database for generating state-
regulated wastes including “Asbestos 
containing waste” that were manifested for off-site
disposal in 2018. Based on the regulatory 
status and lack of listings in other databases
indicating violations and/or a release, this listing
is 
not considered to have created an environmental
concern to the subject property. 
• 
ACTEO Corporation (EDR Map ID: A6, A7), is identified
on the CERS, HAZNET and HWTS 
databases. This facility is identified on the HAZNET
database for generating state-regulated 
wastes including “laboratory waste and off-
specification, aged, or surplus organics” that were 
manifested for off-site disposal in 2000 and 2001.   
• 
H&S Marketing (EDR Map ID: A9), is identified on the
HIST UST, HWTS, and HAZNET databases.  
No information is listed on the HIST UST database. 
The facility is identified on the HAZNET 
database for generating state-regulated wastes
including “off-specification, aged, or surplus 
organics” that were manifested for off-site disposal
in 2010.   
• 
Witco Corp. (EDR Map ID: A2, A12, A14, A18), is
identified on the RCRA-SQG, ECHO, FINDS, 
HWTS, and HAZNET databases. The facility is
identified on the HAZNET database for generating 
state-regulated wastes including “pesticides and
other waste associated with pesticide 
production, other organic solids, liquids w/pH<=2,
and off-specification, aged, or surplus 
organics” that were manifested for off-site disposal
in 1998.

• 
California Transport (EDR Map ID: A15, A17), is
identified on the RCRA-SQG, FINDS, ECHO, and 
HAZNET databases.  No RCRA violations were listed.
RCRA Code D039 (tetrachloroethylene) was 
listed. The facility is identified on the HAZNET
database for generating state-regulated wastes 
including “aqueous solution with total organic
residues less than 10 percent” that were 
manifested for off-site disposal between 2011 and
2014.   
Based on the information provided in the EDR Database
report and results of the Phase II investigation 
(see Section 5.2.6), these listings are not
considered to have the potential to create an
environmental 
concern at the subject property. 
4.2.3 
Adjacent Properties  
The EDR Report identified the following facilities
adjacent to the subject property: 
• 
Agrashell Inc. (EDR Map ID: 50), is listed at 4560
East 26th Street, adjacent to the east beyond 
Ayers Avenue and hydrologically cross-gradient of the
subject property.  The facility is listed as a 
SWEEPS UST, HIST UST, CIWQS, CERS, and EMI databases.
The SWEEPS UST and HIST UST 
databases identified one 1,000-gallon gasoline UST
installed in 1952.  No removal dates were 
provided. Based on the regulatory status and lack of
listing in other databases indicating 
violations and/or a release, it is Partner’s opinion
that this listing does not represent an 
environmental concern to the subject property. 
• 
Fortifiber Corporation (EDR Map ID: 19), is listed at
4489 Bandini Boulevard, adjacent to the south 
and hydrologically down-gradient of the subject
property. The facility is listed as a FINDS, SWEEPS 
UST, HIST UST, RCRA-SQG, HAZNET, WDS, and ECHO
databases.  No RCRA violations were listed. 
The SWEEPS UST and HIST UST databases identified
three USTs including two 12,000-gallon 
gasoline USTs and one 6,000-gallon gasoline UST
installed in 1956.  No removal dates were 
provided.  Based on the regulatory status and lack of
listing in other databases indicating 
violations and/or a release, it is Partner’s opinion
that this listing does not represent an 
environmental concern to the subject property. 
• 
Penetone Corp Div. of West Chemical Prod (EDR Map ID:
C23), is listed at 4425 Bandini Boulevard, 
adjacent to the southwest and hydrologically down-
gradient of the subject property.  The facility is 
listed as a RCRA-SQG, FINDS and ECHO databases.  No
RCRA violations were listed. Based on the 
regulatory status and lack of listing in other
databases indicating violations and/or a release, it
is 
Partner’s opinion that this listing does not
represent an environmental concern to the subject 
property. 
Based on the findings, vapor migration is not
expected to represent a significant environmental
concern 
at this time.

4.2.4 
Site Vicinity 
Partner reviewed the EDR database report to identify
offsite facilities that have suspected or documented 
environmental concerns or RECs that may negatively
impact the subject property.  Partner’s criteria for 
further evaluating the potential impact of a listed
offsite facility are summarized below: 
• 
The listed offsite facility is documented or assumed
to be hydrogeologically up-gradient and a 
likely pathway exists for known releases of
environmentally mobile contaminants to reach the 
subject property; or, contaminants from the listed
offsite facility can reach the subject through 
other pathways (i.e., surface runoff); and, 
• 
The offsite facility is listed as an open case on one
of the following databases: Federal NPL, 
Federal CORRACTS, Federal CERCLIS, Federal ERNS, and
State-Specific lists including, but not 
limited to State Hazardous Waste Sites, State SCL,
State LUST, State Deed Restrictions, State Toxic 
Pits, Landfill (excluding transfer stations); or 
• 
The facility is a known or suspected concern based on
Partner’s experience or observations made 
during the site reconnaissance.  (i.e., Dry-cleaning
operations that may or may not be listed as 
RCRA-SQG or a non-adjacent UST site that appears to
have a remediation system in place). 
Based on a review of previous reports and information
obtained on GeoTracker, several up-gradient
facilities 
in the site vicinity are identified with open and
closed release cases that have impacted groundwater. 
The 
following facilities have an open release case: 
• 
Weld-It Co. (EDR Map ID: H68, H69, H70), is listed at
4477 East Shelia Street, approximately 1,024 
feet to the north and hydrologically up-gradient of
the subject property. This site reported a release 
from a 5,000 gallon UST of gasoline and volatile
organic compounds (including trichloroethylene 
(TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE)) on December 10,
2003, which impacted soil and groundwater.  
The release was reported to the lead agency (RWQCB).
The LUST case is listed as “Open-Site 
Assessment” as of September 19, 2008.  Based on
review of documents on GeoTracker, the UST was 
abandoned in place in 2006 and no remedial actions
have been completed.  The RWQCB issued a 
cleanup and abatement order to the property owner. 
Based on a 2014 groundwater monitoring 
report, groundwater beneath this facility has been
impacted by total petroleum hydrocarbons as 
gasoline (TPHg), and other chemicals including TCE
and PCE.  The furthest downgradient monitoring 
wells are located within Shelia Street (across the
railroad tracks to the north of the subject
property).  
The data indicate that TPHg is present at less than 2
milligrams per liter (mg/l) in groundwater.  PCE 
was detected in these wells at 218 and 335 micrograms
per liter (µg/l). TCE was detected at 19 and 24 
µg/l. Based on the isoconcentrations and groundwater
contour map in the 2013 report, the impacted 
groundwater is moving south-southeast and would
likely pass east of the subject property, not under 
it.  Depth to groundwater is approximately 112 to 115
feet below ground surface (bgs) and flows to 
the south.  On August 21, 2018, the RWQCB issued a
Notice of Violation (NOV) to Weld-It for failing 
to take corrective action in response to the
unauthorized UST release and monitor of groundwater 
(last completed in 2014).  A request for an extension
was request by Weld-It Company on September 
26, 2018.

• 
Premier Plating Property (EDR Map ID: 101), is listed
at 4355 East Shelia Street, 1,470 feet to the 
north and hydrologically up-gradient of the subject
property. The facility is listed on the Los 
Angeles Co. HMS, FINDS, ECHO, RCRA-SQG, SEMS, SLIC,
EnviroStor, HIST UST, UST, HAZNET, LA 
County Site Mitigation databases.  Based on available
information obtained on Envirostor, the site 
has historically been utilized as a plating facility
from the 1960's through the 1980's. Premier 
Plating conducted a plating operation of chrome truck
rims and bumpers for a period of four 
years. Hazardous substances such as chlorinated
hydrocarbons and heavy metals were released 
into the soil. The release was presumably a result of
onsite activities. The RWQCB provided 
oversight for sampling and remediation activities
conducted at the site.  Phase II work began in 
1993 and concluded with a removal action in 1998. The
RWQCB issued a "No Further Action" for 
soil and clean-up investigation.  However, PCE
contaminated perched groundwater was identified 
at 61 feet bgs. The EnviroStor noted that it appeared
that groundwater underlying the site may 
have not been adequately investigated and the case
status is listed as “Inactive –Action Required” 
as of July 18, 2002.  There was no further
information available. 
Based on the regulatory status, these listings have
the potential to impact the groundwater in the site
vicinity.  
Based on distance from the listed sites and depth to
groundwater, vapor intrusion is considered to be 
unlikely.  Partner found no evidence that the subject
property was a groundwater contaminant source. 
4.2.5 
Unmapped Sites 
Partner reviewed EDR’s Orphan Summary, which is a
listing of sites that have not been geocoded based on
lack of sufficient data regarding their exact
location within the general area.  The subject
property was not 
identified as an Unmapped Site.  None of the Unmapped
Sites identified on the Orphan Summary appear to 
be located within the ASTM-designated radii of the
subject property, and therefore, Partner has no
reason to 
believe that these sites had an impact on the subject
property. 
4.3 
Vapor Encroachment Screening 
Partner reviewed the environmental database records
identified in the EDR Radius Report and evaluated 
each reported site relative to a subsurface vapor
encroachment condition, respective a known release,
the 
chemicals of concern, the distance that contaminants
are likely to migrate based on local geological and 
hydrological conditions, sub-grade utility corridors
and preferential pathways, structural components, 
mitigation devices, and other reasonable factors. 
The subsurface vapor encroachment screening was
completed in conformance with ASTM International 
Designation: E2600-15: Standard Guide for Vapor
Encroachment Screening on Property Involved in Real 
Estate Transactions (“ASTM Guide E2600-15”) using
Tier 1 Screening procedures.  
4.3.1 
On-Site Sources for a Vapor Encroachment Condition 
Based on a review of previous reports, agency
records, and current site observations, on-site
sources with 
the potential to create a subsurface vapor
encroachment concern to the subject property and its
receptors 
were not identified. As such, a subsurface vapor
encroachment condition on the subject property
relative 
to an on-site contaminant source does not exist.

4.3.2 
Off-Site Sources for a Vapor Encroachment Condition 
Based on Partner’s review of the Radius Report, no
off-site properties with the potential to create a 
subsurface vapor encroachment concern to the subject
property and its receptors were identified. No off-
site properties with a documented open release of
petroleum hydrocarbons were identified within the 
critical distance - 30 feet up-gradient, cross-
gradient, or down-gradient of the subject property in
the 
Radius Report. No off-site properties with a
documented release of other contaminants of concern
such 
chlorinated volatile organic hydrocarbons were
identified within the critical distance - 100 feet
up-
gradient, cross-gradient, or down-gradient of the
subject property in the Radius Report. 
Based on the physical setting of the subject property
and the findings from historical and regulatory 
records review, an off-site source for a subsurface
vapor encroachment condition was not identified in 
association with the subject property. As such, a
subsurface vapor encroachment condition on the
subject 
property relative to off-site contaminant source does
not exist.

Science, Inc. (October 5, 2020) 
In December 2017, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA and
Phase II Investigation Report for the subject 
property. At the time of the site visit, the subject
property was developed with the existing 
office/warehouse building on the south side of the
site, a former truck repair shed used solely for
storage 
on the northwest side of site, and a guard shack on
the north side of site. The subject property was 
occupied by F&S Distribution, a cartage facility. 
Site operations included receiving and storage of 
products prior to pick up and distribution by various
clients.  The facility warehoused and distributed 
mainly food products (ascorbic and calcium acid,
other additives, sugar, salt), household electronics,
and 
various items such as wood chips and limestone. 
Floors within the former truck maintenance area were 
observed to be heavily stained. 
Hazardous substances observed at the subject property
included hydraulic, transmission, brake, and 
multifunctional fluid, ethylene glycol, engine
coolant, urea solution, “PVC powder”, and plastic
materials, 
stored in 55-gallon drums, 5-gallon buckets, and 10-
liter two-packs.  Urea solution and engine coolant 
were stored in DOT 200-300 gallons totes, primarily
on the loading dock.  These items were not used 
onsite.  According to the site manager, approximately
20 years ago F&S Distribution ceased storing 
hazardous materials such as oils, oxidizers, and
limited solvents and paint-related materials. The
site 
manager reported that minor spills that occurred
previously were confined to the warehouse interior
and 
were cleaned up with absorbent materials immediately.
  
According to City of Vernon Building Department
(CVBD) records, in 1980, two USTs including a 5,000-
gallon gasoline and a 10,000-gallon diesel USTs were
installed at the subject property.  The two USTs and 
an adjacent fuel dispenser were located on the
northwest corner of the subject property, north of
the 
truck repair shed.  In 1986, a CVBD Fire Permit was
issued to remove two USTs (5,000-gallon gasoline and 
10,000-gallon diesel USTs), lines, wells, and pipes
and install one modern welded 20,000-gallon plasteel 
tank and piping. It was noted that between 1988 and
1991, soil samples were taken, and contamination 
was identified that required remediation prior to
installation of the new tank. Soil contamination was 
excavated to clean soil (depth not provided). Lab
results reportedly indicated satisfactory
remediation. The 
Vernon Health Department reportedly authorized the
use of the remediated soil as backfill for the 
excavation.  It is unclear if a new tank was
installed.  No other documentation related to the
former USTs 
was identified. No laboratory data, remediation
reports, or agency closure letters were identified in
CVBD 
files. 
According to a CVBD Mechanical Permit, two 4’X30’
overflow seepage pits were installed at the subject 
property in 1980. The seepage pits were connected to
an existing seepage pit and septic tank.  An 
attached figure depicts the septic tank and three
seepage pits as located adjacent to the northeast
side of 
the building.  In 1986, a Plumbing Permit indicated
that a sewer lateral to the street was installed from
the 
existing warehouse. No further information was
identified regarding the septic tank and associated 
seepage pits.

November 15, 2021 
Page 26 
On December 7, 2017, Partner conducted a Phase II
Subsurface Investigation at the subject property to 
evaluate the location of on-site USTs, former
tankholds, and other features and to evaluate the
potential 
impact of petroleum hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in
the vicinity of the former UST, the truck 
maintenance area, former septic system, and former
storage of cyanide products.  The scope of the Phase 
II Subsurface Investigation included a geophysical
survey and seven soil borings.  Nineteen soil samples
were analyzed for TPH-cc and VOCs, four soil samples
were analyzed for CAM 17 Metals, and two soil 
samples were analyzed for cyanide.   
Analytical results indicated:  
• 
None of the analyzed soil samples contained
detectable concentrations of TPH-cc above 
laboratory PQLs and the PQLs were below applicable
regulatory guidelines. 
• 
None of the detected concentrations of toluene,
ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene in soil exceeded 
applicable screening levels. No other VOCs were
detected in any of the analyzed soil samples 
above applicable regulatory guidelines. 
• 
Mercury concentrations in three soil samples exceeded
background concentrations, but did not 
exceed applicable screening levels.  Arsenic was
detected above screening levels in one soil 
sample, but did not exceed typical background
concentrations.  Therefore, the concentrations of 
arsenic are expected to be naturally occurring. No
other metals were detected in the analyzed soil 
samples at concentrations exceeding laboratory PQLs
and/or typical background concentrations. 
• 
None of the detected concentrations of cyanide in
soil exceeded applicable screening levels. 
The geophysical survey identified one anomaly in the
northwestern portion of the subject property to the 
north of the current truck repair bays. The location
and shape of the anomaly, which consisted of a 
backfilled excavation, generally correspond to the
location of the former USTs.  No large metallic
features 
were identified within either anomaly, which confirms
that the USTs have been removed and no additional 
USTs were installed. 
Based on the geophysical survey, no additional USTs
were installed on-site after the removal and 
remediation of the two former USTs.  In addition,
there did not appear to be residual impacts as a
result 
of the removal of the two former USTs and the
staining and potential septic tank did not appear to
be 
negatively impacting the subject property at that
time.  
Partner recommended no further investigation with
respect to the former USTs, the current truck repair 
bays/staining, or the former septic system at that
time. 
In 2017 and 2018, Environmental Program Management
prepared this report on behalf of LBA Realty, LLC. 
According to these reports, the program is designed
to maintain the potential LBP and ACMs on-site. 
These reports outline the implemented management
practices including training activities, 
renovation/remodeling requirements, periodic
surveillance, etc. 
In 2018, Partner prepared an ESA report on behalf of
LBA RVI – Company VIII, LLC. At the time of the 2018 
assessment, the subject building was vacant and
undergoing renovations. Renovations include
demolition

of the former truck repair shed and guard shack,
removal of the propane tank, reconfigure office space
(northeast corner of the building) and four new
restrooms, new transformer adjacent to the northwest 
corner of the building, new skylights and roof, and
exterior paint.   An open electrical trench was
observed 
crossing the parking lot from East 26th Street to the
northwest corner of the building.  A railroad spur is
located adjacent to the south side of the building.  
No evidence of current ASTs or USTs was observed
during the site reconnaissance.  In 2018, one onsite 
AST containing propane for fueling onsite forklifts
was removed on the east side of the property as part
of 
current renovation activities.  Two USTs and an
adjacent fuel dispenser were formerly located on the 
northwest corner of the subject property. 
In 2018, former truck repair shed on the northwest
corner of the property was removed.  In November 
2017, heavy buildup of old oil was observed on the
paved surface in the former truck repair shed located
on the northwest corner of the property.  The former
truck repair shed was removed as part of current 
renovation activities. No drains were observed in the
truck repair shed at the time of removal.   
Partner identified the following HRECs and
environmental issues: 
• 
In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical
survey and a Phase II Subsurface 
Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the
location of former on-site UST tankholds and 
to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum
hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the 
former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former
septic system, and former storage of cyanide 
products.  Based on the removal of the tanks, the
geophysical survey, and the analytical results, 
the former USTs, truck maintenance area, septic
system, and storage of cyanide products are 
considered a HREC and no further action is considered
necessary.  
• 
Due to the age of the subject property buildings,
there was potential that asbestos-containing 
material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are
present.  Suspect ACMs would need to be 
sampled to confirm the presence or absence of
asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition 
activities to prevent potential exposure to workers
and/or building occupants. Partner 
recommended ACM be managed under an Operations and
Maintenance (O&M) Program.  
Partner recommended no further investigation. 
In October 2020, Partner prepared a Phase I ESA
Report for the subject property. At the time of the
site 
visit, the subject property was developed with the
existing office/warehouse building on the south side
of 
the site. The subject property was occupied by ACCO,
an HVAC equipment and installation company. Site 
operations included offices, warehouse/equipment
storage, and equipment maintenance activities. 
No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of
hazardous substances was observed on the subject 
property. No evidence of current aboveground storage
tanks (ASTs) or underground storage tanks (USTs) 
was observed during the site reconnaissance. 
The findings of the October 2020 Phase I ESA were
similar to previous reports prepared by Partner. 
Partner recommended no further investigation. 
Copies of reports reviewed are included in Appendix
B.

6.1 
General Site Characteristics 
6.1.1 
Solid Waste Disposal 
Solid waste generated at the subject property is
disposed in commercial dumpsters located in the
western 
portion of the subject property.  An independent
solid waste disposal contractor, Waste Management, 
removes solid waste from the subject property.  No
evidence of illegal dumping of solid waste was 
observed during the Partner site reconnaissance.   No
further investigation or corrective actions are 
warranted.  
6.1.2 
Sewage Discharge and Disposal 
Sanitary discharges on the subject property are
directed into the municipal sanitary sewer system 
operated by the City of Vernon.   
6.1.3 
Surface Water Drainage 
Storm water is removed from the subject property
primarily by sheet flow action across the paved 
surfaces towards storm water drains located
throughout the subject property and in the public
right of 
way.  Site storm water from roofs, landscaped areas,
and paved areas is directed to on-site concrete 
swales, which drain to the public right of way, and
to on-site storm water drains.  The subject property
is 
connected to a municipal owned and maintained sewer
system. 
The subject property does not appear to be a
designated wetland area, based on information
obtained 
from the United States Department of Agriculture.  A
comprehensive wetlands survey would be required 
in order to formally determine actual wetlands on the
subject property.  No surface impoundments, 
wetlands, natural catch basins, settling ponds, or
lagoons are located on the subject property.  No 
drywells were identified on the subject property.

observed during the site reconnaissance. 
6.2 
Potential Environmental Hazards 
6.2.1 
Hazardous Substances and Petroleum Products Used or
Stored at the Site 
No evidence of the use of reportable quantities of
hazardous substances was observed on the subject 
property.  Small quantities of general maintenance
supplies were found to be properly labeled and stored
at the time of the assessment with no signs of leaks,
stains, or spills.  The storage and use of
maintenance 
supplies does not appear to pose a significant threat
to the environmental integrity of the subject 
property at this time. 
6.2.2 
Aboveground & Underground Hazardous Substance or
Petroleum Product Storage 
Tanks (ASTs/USTs) 
No evidence of current or former ASTs or USTs was
observed during the site reconnaissance.   
6.2.3 
Evidence of Releases 
No spills, stains, or other indications that a
surficial release has occurred at the subject
property were 
observed. 
6.2.4 
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) 
Older transformers and other electrical equipment
could contain PCBs at a level that subjects them to 
regulation by the U.S. EPA.  PCBs in electrical
equipment are controlled by United States
Environmental 
Protection Agency regulations 40 CFR, Part 761. Under
the regulations, there are three categories into 
which electrical equipment can be classified: 1) Less
than 50 parts per million (ppm) of PCBs – “Non-PCB;” 
2) 50 ppm-500 ppm – “PCB-Contaminated;” and, 3)
Greater than 500 ppm – “PCB-Containing.”  The 
manufacture, process, or distribution in commerce or
use of any PCB in any manner other than in a totally 
enclosed manner was prohibited after July 2, 1979. 
 
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment 
Project No. 21-342562.35

Page 30 
The on-site reconnaissance addressed indoor and
outdoor transformers that may contain PCBs.  One pad-
mounted transformer was observed on the subject
property.  The transformer is not labeled indicating 
PCB content.  No staining or leakage was observed in
the vicinity of the transformer.   
No other potential PCB-containing equipment (interior
transformers, oil-filled switches, hoists, lifts,
dock 
levelers, hydraulic elevators, balers, etc.) was
observed on the subject property during Partner’s 
reconnaissance. 
6.2.5 
Strong, Pungent or Noxious Odors 
No strong, pungent, or noxious odors were evident
during the site reconnaissance. 
6.2.6 
Pools of Liquid 
No pools of liquid were observed on the subject
property during the site reconnaissance. 
6.2.7 
Drains, Sumps and Clarifiers 
No drains, sumps, or clarifiers, other than those
associated with storm water removal, were observed on
the subject property during the site reconnaissance. 
6.2.8 
Pits, Ponds and Lagoons 
No pits, ponds or lagoons were observed on the
subject property. 
6.2.9 
Stressed Vegetation 
No stressed vegetation was observed on the subject
property. 
6.2.10 Additional Potential Environmental Hazards 
No additional environmental hazards, including
landfill activities or radiological hazards, were
observed. 
6.3 
Non-ASTM Services 
6.3.1 
Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACMs) 
Asbestos is the name given to a number of naturally
occurring, fibrous silicate minerals mined for their 
useful properties such as thermal insulation,
chemical and thermal stability, and high tensile
strength.  The 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain 
construction materials to be presumed to contain
asbestos, for purposes of this regulation. 
Construction 
materials including, but not limited to, thermal
system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and 
asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building
and that have not been appropriately tested may be 
considered “presumed asbestos-containing material”
(PACM). 
The subject property building was constructed in
1960.  Partner has conducted a limited, visual
evaluation 
of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs
at the subject property.  The objective of this
visual 
survey was to note the presence and condition of
suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table
below 
for identified suspect ACMs:

The limited visual survey consisted of noting
observable materials (materials which were readily
accessible 
and visible during the course of the site
reconnaissance) that are commonly known to
potentially contain 
asbestos.   
According to the US EPA, ACM and PACM that is intact
and in good condition can, in general, be 
managed safely in-place under an Operations and
Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated 
by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material
condition.  Prior to any disturbance of the 
construction materials within this facility, a
comprehensive ACM survey is recommended.  ACM is 
managed under the LBA Realty O&M Program. 
6.3.2 
Lead-Based Paint (LBP) 
Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually
every system of the body.  LBP is defined as any
paint, 
varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1
mg/cm2 (or 5,000 ug/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of 
lead.   
Due to the commercial nature of use of the subject
property, LBP was not considered within the scope of 
this assessment. 
6.3.3 
Radon 
Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring,
radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by 
radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms.  The US EPA
has prepared a map to assist National, State, and 
local organizations to target their resources and to
implement radon-resistant building codes.  The map 
divides the country into three Radon Zones, according
to the table below:  
EPA Radon Zones 
EPA Zones 
Average Predicted Radon Levels 
Potential 
Zone 1 
Exceed 4.0 pCi/L 
Highest 
Zone 2 
Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L 
Moderate 
Zone 3 
Less than 2.0 pCi/L 
Low 
 
 
 
 
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment 
Project No. 21-342562.35

Page 32 
It is important to note that the EPA has found homes
with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and
the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order
to determine radon levels at a specific location.  
However, the map does give a valuable indication of
the propensity of radon gas accumulation in 
structures.   
Radon sampling was not conducted as part of this
assessment.  Review of the US EPA Map of Radon 
Zones places the subject property in Zone 2.  Based
upon the radon zone classification, radon is not 
considered to be a significant environmental concern.
6.3.4 
Lead in Drinking Water 
According to available information, a public water
system operated by the City of Vernon Public Works 
Water & Development Services serves the subject
property vicinity. Shallow groundwater directly
beneath 
the subject property is not utilized for domestic
purposes.  The sources of public water for the City
of 
Vernon are surface water from the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California (MWD) which is a 
blend of Colorado River water and water from the
northern State Water Project as well as groundwater 
pumped from local deep wells in the Central
Groundwater Basin.  According to the City of Vernon
and the 
2020 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to
the subject property is in compliance with all State 
and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water
standards, including lead and copper.  Water 
sampling was not conducted to verify water quality. 
6.3.5 
Microbial Growth 
Microbial growths are microscopic organisms found
virtually everywhere, indoors and outdoors.  
Microbial growths will grow and multiply under the
right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture 
(e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation,
or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic 
material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or
natural fiber carpet padding).   
Partner observed accessible, interior areas of the
subject property building for significant evidence of
microbial growth with the exceptions detailed in
Section 1.5 of this report; however, this ESA should
not 
be used as a microbial growths survey or inspection. 
This limited assessment was not designed to assess 
all areas of potential microbial growth that may be
affected by microbial growth on the subject property.
 
Rather, it is intended to give the client an
indication as to whether or not conspicuous (based on
observed 
areas) microbial growth is present at the subject
property. This evaluation did not include a review of
pipe 
chases, mechanical systems, or areas behind enclosed
walls and ceilings. 
No obvious indications of water damage or microbial
growth were observed during Partner’s visual 
assessment.   
6.4 
Adjacent Property Reconnaissance 
The adjacent property reconnaissance consisted of
observing the adjacent properties from the subject 
property premises.  No items of environmental concern
were identified on the adjacent properties during 
the site assessment, including hazardous substances,
petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of 
releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of
liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons,
stressed 
vegetation, or any other potential environmental
hazards.

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 
Findings 
A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to
the presence or likely presence of any hazardous 
substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a
property: due to release to the environment; under 
conditions indicative of a release to the
environment; or under conditions that pose a material
threat of a 
future release to the environment.   
• 
Partner did not identify RECs during the course of
this assessment. 
A controlled recognized environmental condition
(CREC) refers to a REC resulting from a past release
of 
hazardous substances or petroleum products that has
been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable 
regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or
petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject
to the implementation of required controls.  The
following was identified during the course of this 
assessment:   
• 
Partner did not identify CRECs during the course of
this assessment. 
A historical recognized environmental condition
(HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous 
substances or petroleum products that has occurred in
connection with the property and has been 
addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable
regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use
criteria 
established by a regulatory authority, without
subjecting the property to any required controls. 
The 
following was identified during the course of this
assessment:   
• 
In December 2017, Partner conducted a geophysical
survey and a Phase II Subsurface 
Investigation at the subject property to evaluate the
location of former on-site UST tankholds and 
to evaluate the potential impact of petroleum
hydrocarbons and VOCs to soil in the vicinity of the 
former USTs, the truck maintenance area, former
septic system, and former storage of cyanide 
products.  Based on the removal of the tanks with
agency involvement, the geophysical survey, 
and the analytical results, the former USTs, truck
maintenance area, septic system, and storage of 
cyanide products are considered a HREC and no further
action is considered necessary.  
An environmental issue refers to environmental
concerns identified by Partner, which do not qualify
as 
RECs; however, warrant further discussion.  The
following was identified during the course of this 
assessment: 
• 
Partner did not identify environmental issues during
the course of this assessment.
