      "{'1.0': ' 1.0    INTRODUCTION Partner Engineering and Science, Inc. (Partner) has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-21 and the Environmental Protection Agency Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 CFR Part 312) for the property located at 115 West Anapamu Street in Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara County, California (the “subject property”).  Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this scope of work are described in the report.', '1.1': ' 1.1    Purpose The purpose of this ESA is to identify existing or potential Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined by ASTM Standard E1527-21) affecting the subject property that: 1) constitute or result in a material violation or a potential material violation of any applicable environmental law; 2) impose any material constraints on the operation of the subject property or require a material change in the use thereof; 3) require clean-up, remedial action or other response with respect to Hazardous Substances or Petroleum Products on or affecting the subject property under any applicable environmental law; 4) may affect the value of the subject property; and 5) may require specific actions to be performed with regard to such conditions and circumstances. The information contained in the ESA Report will be used by Client to: 1) evaluate its legal and financial liabilities for transactions related to foreclosure, purchase, sale, loan origination, loan workout or seller financing; 2) evaluate the subject property’s overall development potential, the associated market value and the impact of applicable laws that restrict financial and other types of assistance for the future development of the subject property; and/or 3) determine whether specific actions are required to be performed prior to the foreclosure, purchase, sale, loan origination, loan workout or seller financing of the subject property. This ESA was performed to permit the User to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on scope of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. §9601) liability (hereinafter, the “landowner liability protections,” or “LLPs”). ASTM Standard E1527-21 constitutes “all appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice” as defined at 42 U.S.C. §9601(35)(B).', '1.2': ' 1.2    Scope of Work The scope of work for this ESA is in accordance with and to the extent necessary to achieve the goal of the requirements set forth in the ASTM Standard E1527-21. This assessment included: 1) a property and adjoining site reconnaissance; 2) interviews with key personnel; 3) a review of historical sources; 4) a review of regulatory agency records; and 5) a review of a regulatory database report provided by a third-party vendor. Partner contacted local agencies, such as environmental health departments, fire departments and building departments to obtain readily ascertainable information to determine any current and/or former hazardous substances usage, storage and/or releases of hazardous substances on the subject property. Additionally, Partner researched readily available information on the presence of activity and use limitations (AULs) at these agencies. As defined by ASTM E1527-21, AULs include both legal (that is, institutional) and physical (that is, engineering) controls that may include legal or physical restrictions or limitations on the use of, or access to, a site or facility: 1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil, soil vapor, groundwater, or surface water on the subject property; or 2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significant risk to public health or the environment. These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls (IC/ECs), are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil, soil vapor, groundwater, and/or surface water on a property. If requested by Client, this report may also include the identification, discussion of, and/or limited sampling of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), mold, and/or radon.', '1.3': ' 1.3    Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work. These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions. There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information. Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable. However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete. The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client. No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies. This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs. Further, this report does not intend to address all of the compliance and safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water. These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues. If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.', '1.4': ' 1.4    User Reliance Thompson Housing, LLC engaged Partner to perform this assessment in accordance with an agreement governing the nature, scope and purpose of the work as well as other matters critical to the engagement. All reports, both verbal and written, are for the sole use and benefit of Thompson Housing, LLC. Either verbally or in writing, third parties may come into possession of this report or all or part of the information generated as a result of this work.  In the absence of a written agreement with Partner granting such rights, no third parties shall have rights of recourse or recovery whatsoever under any course of action against Partner, its officers, employees, vendors, successors or assigns.  Any such unauthorized user shall be responsible to protect, indemnify and hold Partner, Client and their respective officers, employees, vendors, successors and assigns harmless from any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and costs attributable to such Use.  Unauthorized use of this report shall constitute acceptance of and commitment to these responsibilities, which shall be irrevocable and shall apply regardless of the cause of action or legal theory pled or asserted.  Additional legal penalties may apply.', '1.5': ' 1.5    Limiting Conditions The findings and conclusions contain all the limitations inherent in these methodologies that are referred to in ASTM Practice E1527-21. Specific limitations and exceptions to this ESA are more specifically set forth below: • Interviews with past or current owners, operators and occupants were not reasonably ascertainable and thus constitute a data gap. Based on information obtained from other historical sources, this data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment. • Partner requested information relative to deed restrictions and environmental liens, a title search, and completion of the AAI User Questionnaire from the Report User. This information was not provided at the time of the assessment. This data gap is not expected to alter the findings of this assessment.'}\n",

      "{'2.0': ' 2.0    SITE DESCRIPTION', '2.1': ' 2.1    Site Location and Legal Description The subject property at 115 West Anapamu Street in Santa Barbara, California is located on the southeast side of West Anapamu Street, between Chapala Street and De La Vina Street. According to the Santa Barbara County Assessor, the subject property is legally described as Assessor Parcel Numbers 039-222- 028 and 039-222-029. Parcel 028 was a public alley on the southwest side of the subject property deeded by the City of Santa Barbara to Sanctuary Centers of Santa Barbara in May 2019. According to the property owner, ownership is currently vested in Sanctuary Centers of Santa Barbara, which acquired the subject property as Sanctuary House of Santa Barbara, Inc., a California nonprofit public benefit corporation dba Sanctuary Psychiatric Centers of Santa Barbara since 1995. Please refer to Figure 1: Site Location Map, Figure 2: Site Plan, Figure 3: Topographic Map, and Appendix A: Site Photographs for the location and site characteristics of the subject property.', '2.2': ' 2.2    Current Property Use The subject property is currently occupied by Sanctuary Centers of Santa Barbara with eight residential units for residential use. Onsite operations consist of residential and property maintenance activities. The subject property consists of one two-story, eight-unit residential building (Building A) with a partial basement, on the northwest side of the subject property, fronting West Anapamu Street, and two one-story cottages (Buildings B & C) currently vacant but previously used as a medical/dental clinic and counseling center, located on the southeast side of the subject property. In addition to the current structures, the subject property is also improved with asphalt-paved parking areas and associated landscaping. The subject property is designated for C-G for General Commercial development by the City of Santa Barbara Planning Department. The subject property was not identified in the regulatory database report of Section 4.2.', '2.3': ' 2.3    Current Use of Adjoining Properties The subject property is located within a residential and commercial area of Santa Barbara County. During the vicinity reconnaissance, Partner observed the land uses on adjoining properties as defined in ASTM Practice E1527-21 as any real property or properties the border of which is contiguous or partially contiguous with that of the property, or that would be contiguous or partially contiguous with that of the property but for a street, road, or other public thoroughfare separating them. The adjoining properties are tabulated below: Adjoining Properties North: West Anapamu Street, across which is an office building (104 West Anapamu Street) Northeast: An apartment building (109 West Anapamu Street) and a multi-tenant office building (1123 Chapala Street) East: A multi-tenant office building (1111 Chapala Street) Southeast: Parking lot for the Santa Barbara Club (1105 Chapala Street) South: Garden Court retirement community (1116 De La Vina Street) and Social Security Administration office (122 West Figueroa Street) Southwest: An apartment building (125 West Anapamu Street) and the Garden Courts on De La Vina (1116 De La Vina Street) West: West Anapamu Street, across which is Spencer Adams Park (1212 De La Vina Street) Northwest: West Anapamu Street, across which is a parking lot for a multi-tenant office building (104 West Anapamu Street) The adjoining property to the north was identified as a Facility Index System (FINDS), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Non-Generator (NonGen), California Environmental Reporting System (CERS) and Emissions site in the regulatory database report of section 4.2. The adjoining property to the southeast is identified as a Leaking Storage Tank (LUST), Santa Barbara County- Fire Department Leaking Underground Fuel Tanks (LUST SANBARB), and Santa Barbara County- Site Mitigation Unit (SMU) Master Site List (SMU SANBARB) site in the regulatory database report of Section 4.2.', '2.4': ' 2.4    Physical Setting Sources', '2.4.1': ' 2.4.1    Topography The 2022 United States Geological Survey (USGS) Santa Barbara, CA Quadrangle 7.5-minute series topographic map was reviewed for this ESA. According to the contour lines on the topographic map, the subject property is located at approximately 75 feet above mean sea level (MSL). The contour lines in the area of the subject property indicate the area is sloping gently towards the southeast. A copy of the most recent topographic map is included as Figure 3 of this report.', '2.4.2': ' 2.4.2    Hydrology While under natural and undisturbed conditions shallow groundwater flow most frequently follows the topography of the land surface, natural or man-made features can affect flow direction, and the presumed flow may not match the actual flow directions at the subject property and vicinity. Information reviewed in previous reports provided suggests the direction of groundwater flow in the vicinity of the subject property is inferred to be toward the southeast. According to information reviewed in previous reports provided, the depth to groundwater in the vicinity of the subject property inferred to be approximately 50 feet bgs. The nearest surface water in the vicinity of the subject property is Mission Creek located approximately 0.32 and southwest of the subject property. No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed at the subject property during this assessment. According to available information, a public water system operated by the public water system operated by the Santa Barbra Department of Water Resources serves the subject property vicinity.  The sources of public water for the City of Santa Barbra are groundwater from Lake Cachuma, Gibraltar Reservoir, and the Charles E. Myers Desalination Plant.', '2.4.3': ' 2.4.3    Geology/Soils The subject property is located in the western portion of the Transverse Ranges Geomorphic Province that is locally dominated by the east-west trending Santa Ynez Mountain Range. The Santa Ynez Mountains and adjacent lowlands are composed primarily of marine and non-marine sedimentary rocks ranging in age from Cretaceous to Recent. The Santa Barbara area geology consists of a south-dipping monocline and adjacent coastal plain, comprised of a series of subparallel folds and faults. Santa Barbara is located on a gently-sloping coastal plain that formed from alluvium derived from local uplands. The alluvium consists of marine terrace, fluvial and estuary/lagoonal deposits of Quaternary age. These sediments commonly consist of interbedded, unconsolidated to poorly consolidated sand, silt, clay, and occasional gravel lenses of the Santa Barbara Formation, Monterey Formation, Rincon Shale Vaqueros Sandstone, Seeps Formation, Coldwater Sandstone, Cozy Dell Shale, Marilia Sandstone, Juncial Formation and Jalapa Formation. Based on information obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service Web Soil Survey online database, the subject property is mapped as Milpitas-Positas fine sandy loam. Milpitas soils are described as moderately well drained fine sandy loam and gravelly clay which formed from mixed alluvium. Positas soils are described as moderately well drained fine sandy loam and clay which formed from mixed alluvium. Slopes range from 2 to 9 percent.', '2.4.4': ' 2.4.4    Flood Zone Information Partner performed a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. According to Community Panel Number 06083C1387J, dated September 28, 2018, the subject property appears to be located in Zone X (unshaded); defined as minimal risk areas outside the 1-percent and 0.2-percent-annual-chance floodplains.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101 requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation. All thermal system insulation (TSI), surfacing material, and asphalt/vinyl flooring that are present in a building that have not been appropriately tested are “presumed asbestos-containing material” (PACM). The subject property buildings were constructed in prior to 1930 (Buildings B & C) and in 1950 (Building A). A limited, visual evaluation of accessible areas for the presence of suspect ACMs at the subject property was conducted. Of note, the interior of the residential units was not accessible.  The objective of this visual survey was to note the presence and condition of suspect ACM observed.  Please refer to the table below for identified suspect ACMs: Suspect ACMs Suspect ACM Location Friable Yes/No Physical Condition Drywall Systems Throughout Building Interior No Good Plaster Throughout Building Interior No Good Stucco exterior Building Exteriors Yes Good Based on this building’s date of construction, prior to disturbance, Partner recommends a comprehensive asbestos survey of the property be completed to determine the presence, condition, friability and likely future condition of suspect or confirmed ACM.  All suspect materials must be handled as ACM according to local, state and federal regulations until the results of sampling and analysis indicate the material is a non-ACM. According to the US EPA, ACM that is intact and in good condition can, in general, be managed safely in-place under an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program until removal is dictated by renovation, demolition, or deteriorating material condition. Of note, a reported 0.23 ton of asbestos-containing materials was removed from the subject property in 2010, during renovation activities. However, the type and location of the ACM was not reported. Also of note, at the time of the site inspection, asbestos sampling was underway within Buildings B&C. Partner was not provided building plans or specifications for review, which may have been useful in determining areas likely to have used ACM.', '6.3.2': ' 6.3.2    Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Lead is a highly toxic metal that affects virtually every system of the body. LBP is defined as any paint, varnish, stain, or other applied coating that has 1 mg/cm2 (or 5,000 µg/g or 0.5% by weight) or more of lead. Congress passed the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known as “Title X,” to protect families from exposure to lead from paint, dust, and soil. Under Section 1017 of Title X, intact LBP on most walls and ceilings is not considered a “hazard,” although the condition of the paint should be monitored and maintained to ensure that it does not become deteriorated. Further, Section 1018 of this law directed the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the US EPA to require the disclosure of known information on LBP and LBP hazards before the sale or lease of most housing built before 1978. Based on the age of the subject property buildings (pre-1978), there is a potential that LBP is present. Interior and exterior painted surfaces were observed in good condition and therefore not expected to represent a \"hazard,\" although the condition of the paint should be monitored and maintained to ensure it does not become deteriorated. Actual material samples would need to be collected in order to determine if LBP is present.', '6.3.3': ' 6.3.3    Radon Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium (Ra) atoms. The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes. The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, according to the table below: EPA Radon Zones EPA Zones Average Predicted Radon Levels Potential Zone 1 Exceed 4.0 pCi/L Highest Zone 2 Between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L Moderate Zone 3 Less than 2.0 pCi/L Low It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the US EPA recommends site-specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Review of the US EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 1. Based upon the residential nature of the subject property, radon is considered an environmental concern. As such, additional investigation appears warranted. Of note, the residential building (Building A) is underlain by a partial basement on the southeast side.', '6.3.4': ' 6.3.4    Lead in Drinking Water According to available information, a public water system operated by the public water system operated by the Santa Barbra Department of Water Resources serves the subject property vicinity. The sources of public water for the City of Santa Barbra are groundwater from Lake Cachuma, Gibraltar Reservoir, and the Charles E. Myers Desalination Plant According to the 2022 Annual Water Quality Report, water supplied to the subject property is in compliance with all State and Federal regulations pertaining to drinking water standards, including lead and copper. Water sampling was not conducted to verify water quality.', '6.3.5': ' 6.3.5    Mold Molds are microscopic organisms found virtually everywhere, indoors and outdoors.  Mold will grow and multiply under the right conditions, needing only sufficient moisture (e.g.in the form of very high humidity, condensation, or water from a leaking pipe, etc.) and organic material (e.g., ceiling tile, drywall, paper, or natural fiber carpet padding). No obvious indications of water damage or mold growth were observed during Partner’s visual assessment.', '6.3.6': ' 6.3.6    Wetlands The subject property does not appear to be a designated wetland area based on information obtained from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service; however, a comprehensive wetlands survey would be required in order to formally determine actual wetlands on the subject property. No settling ponds, lagoons, surface impoundments, wetlands or natural catch basins were observed at the subject property during this assessment.', '6.4': ' 6.4    Adjoining Property Reconnaissance The adjoining property reconnaissance consisted of observing the adjoining properties from the subject property premises. No items of environmental concern were identified on the adjoining properties during the site assessment, including hazardous substances, petroleum products, ASTs, USTs, evidence of releases, PCBs, strong or noxious odors, pools of liquids, sumps or clarifiers, pits or lagoons, stressed vegetation, or any other potential environmental hazards.'}\n",

      "{'7.0': ' 7.0    VAPOR ENCROACHMENT CONDITIONS Partner conducted a limited non-intrusive vapor screening on the subject property to identify, to the extent feasible, the potential for vapor encroachment conditions (VECs) in connection with the subject property. This included consideration of chemicals of concern (COC) that may migrate as vapors into the subsurface of the subject property as a result of contaminated soil and groundwater on or near the property. This screening utilized readily available data sources previously discussed in this Phase I ESA that includes: • the physical setting of the subject property (Section 2.4), • standard historical sources for the subject property, adjoining, and surrounding area (Section 3.0), • known or potentially contaminated sites as identified from information from regulatory agencies and sites on Federal, State, tribal and local databases (Section 4.0), and • information from the site reconnaissance (Section 6.0) of the subject property and observations of the surrounding properties. The results of our data collection, reconnaissance, and analysis are tabulated below: Potential for Vapor Encroachment to Impact the Subject Property Area of Concern Likely or Known VEC to Subject Property Subject Property Existing Operations or Conditions None identified that impact the subject property. Refer to Sections 2.0 Site Description and 6.0 Site Reconnaissance and discussion below. Historical Uses of the Subject Property None identified that impact the subject property. Refer to Section 3.0 Historical Use and discussion below. Adjoining Property Operations or Existing Conditions None identified that impact the subject property. Refer to Sections 2.3 Current Use of Adjoining Properties and 6.4 Adjoining Property Site Reconnaissance and discussion below. Historical Uses of Adjoining Properties or Nearby Properties None identified that impact the subject property. Refer to Section 3.0 Historical Use and discussion below. Regulatory Review of sites identified on Federal, State, tribal and Local Environmental Databases which were located in the AMSD None identified that impact the subject property. Refer to Section 4.0 Regulatory Review and discussion below. Based on the findings of the limited non-intrusive vapor screening, vapor intrusion is unlikely to be an issue of concern in connection with the existing structures on the subject property. As such, no further assessment is recommended.'}\n",

      "{'8.0': ' 8.0    FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Findings and Opinions Recognized Environmental Condition A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence of hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at the subject property due to a release to the environment; the likely presence of hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at the subject property due to a release or likely release to the environment; or the presence of hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at the subject property under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. • Partner did not identify any RECs during the course of this assessment. Controlled Recognized Environmental Condition A controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC) refers to a REC affecting the subject property that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or authorities with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls (for example, activity and use limitations or other property use limitations). • Partner did not identify any CRECs during the course of this assessment. Historical Recognized Environmental Condition A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a previous release of hazardous substances or petroleum products affecting the subject property that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or authorities and meeting unrestricted use criteria established by the applicable regulatory authority or authorities without subjecting the subject property to any controls (for example, activity and use limitations or other property use limitations). • Partner did not identify any HRECs during the course of this assessment. Business Environmental Risk A Business Environmental Risk (BER) is a risk which can have a material environmental or environmentally driven impact on the business associated with the current or planned use of commercial real estate, not necessarily related to those environmental issues required to be investigated in this practice. The following was identified during the course of this assessment: • Due to the age of the subject property buildings, there is a potential that asbestos-containing material (ACM) and/or lead-based paint (LBP) are present. The identified suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. • Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive, inert, gaseous element formed by radioactive decay of radium atoms. Review of the EPA Map of Radon Zones places the subject property in Zone 1, where average predicted radon levels exceed the EPA’s action level of 4.0 picoCuries per Liter (pCi/L).  Given the residential usage of the subject property, the radon zone is considered to be an environmental concern. Significant Data Gaps No significant data gaps affecting the ability of the Environmental Professional to identify a REC were encountered during this assessment. Conclusions and Recommendations Partner has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E1527-21 of 115 West Anapamu Street in Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara County, California (the “subject property”). Any exceptions to, or deletions from, this practice are described in Section 1.5 of this report. This assessment has revealed no evidence of RECs, CRECs, or HRECs, in connection with the subject property; however, BERS were identified. Based on the conclusions of this assessment, Partner recommends the following: • An Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Program should be implemented in order to safely manage the suspect ACMs and LBP located at the subject property. In addition, the identified suspect ACMs would need to be sampled to confirm the presence or absence of asbestos prior to any renovation or demolition activities to prevent potential exposure to workers and/or building occupants. • Partner recommends that short term radon testing be conducted at the subject property in order to determine if elevated radon levels are present and to establish an average radon level for the property.'}\n",

      "SUBSECTION CONTEXT:   1.3 Limitations Partner warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein were accomplished in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the Scope of Work.  These methodologies are described as representing good commercial and customary practice for conducting an ESA of a property for the purpose of identifying recognized environmental conditions.  There is a possibility that even with the proper application of these methodologies there may exist on the subject property conditions that could not be identified within the scope of the assessment or which were not reasonably identifiable from the available information.  Partner believes that the information obtained from the record review and the interviews concerning the subject property is reliable.  However, Partner cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that the information provided by these other sources is accurate or complete.  The conclusions and findings set forth in this report are strictly limited in time and scope to the date of the evaluations. The conclusions presented in the report are based solely on the services described therein, and not on scientific tasks or procedures beyond the scope of agreed-upon services or the time and budgeting restraints imposed by the Client.  No other warranties are implied or expressed. Some of the information provided in this report is based upon personal interviews, and research of available documents, records, and maps held by the appropriate government and private agencies.  This report is subject to the limitations of historical documentation, availability, and accuracy of pertinent records, and the personal recollections of those persons contacted. This practice does not address requirements of any state or local laws or of any federal laws other than the all appropriate inquiry provisions of the LLPs.  Further, this report does not intend to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with the subject property. Environmental concerns, which are beyond the scope of a Phase I ESA as defined by ASTM include the following: ACMs, LBP, radon, and lead in drinking water.  These issues may affect environmental risk at the subject property and may warrant discussion and/or assessment; however, are considered non-scope issues.  If specifically requested by the Client, these non-scope issues are discussed in Section 6.3.\n",
